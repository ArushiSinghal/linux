USB port LED trigger
====================

This LED trigger can be used for signalling to the user a presence of USB device
in a given port. It simply turns on LED when device appears and turns it off
when it disappears.

It requires specifying a list of USB ports that should be observed. Used format
matches Linux kernel format and consists of a root hub number and a hub port
separated by a dash (e.g. 3-1).

It is also possible to handle devices with internal hubs (that are always
connected to the root hub). User can simply specify internal hub ports then
(e.g. 1-1.1, 1-1.2, etc.).

Please note that this trigger allows assigning multiple USB ports to a single
LED. This can be useful in two cases:

1) Device with single USB LED and few physical ports

In such a case LED will be turned on as long as there is at least one connected
USB device.

2) Device with a physical port handled by few controllers

Some devices have e.g. one controller per PHY standard. E.g. USB 3.0 physical
port may be handled by ohci-platform, ehci-platform and xhci-hcd. If there is
only one LED user will most likely want to assign ports from all 3 hubs.


This trigger can be activated from user space on led class devices as shown
below:

  echo usbport > trigger

This adds the following sysfs attributes to the LED:

  ports - Reading it lists all USB ports assigned to the trigger. Writing USB
	  port number to it will make this driver start observing it. It's also
	  possible to remove USB port from observable list by writing it with a
	  "-" prefix.

Example use-case:

  echo usbport > trigger
  echo 4-1 > ports
  echo 2-1 > ports
  echo -4-1 > ports
  cat ports
