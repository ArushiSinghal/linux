USB port LED trigger
====================

This LED trigger can be used for signaling user a presence of USB device in a
given port. It simply turns on LED when device appears and turns it off when it
disappears.

It requires specifying a list of USB ports that should be observed. Used format
matches Linux kernel format and consists of a root hub number and a hub port
separated by a dash (e.g. 3-1).

This also allows handling devices with internal hubs (when root hub's port has
always a device (hub) connected). User can simply specify specify internal hub
ports then (e.g. 1-1.1, 1-1.2, etc.).

Please note that this trigger allows assigning multiple USB ports to a single
LED. This can be useful in two cases:

1) Device with single USB LED and few physical ports

In such case LED will be turned on as long as there is at least one connected
USB device.

2) Device with a physical port handled by few controllers

Some devices have e.g. one controller per PHY standard. E.g. USB 2.0 physical
port may be handled by ohci-platform, ehci-platform and xhci-hcd. If there is
only one LED user will most likely want to assign ports from all 3 hubs.


This trigger can be activated from user space on led class devices as shown
below:

  echo usbport > trigger

This adds the following sysfs attributes to the LED:

  ports - allows listing all USB ports assigned to the trigger.

  new_port - allows adding a new USB port by simply writing to it.

Example use-case:

  echo usbport > trigger
  echo 4-1 > new_port
  echo 2-1 > new_port
  cat ports
