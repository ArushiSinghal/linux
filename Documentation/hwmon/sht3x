Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHT3x-DIS chip, a humidity
and temperature sensor. Temperature is measured in degrees celsius, relative
humidity is expressed as a percentage. In the sysfs interface, all values are
scaled by 1000, i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500.

The device communicates with the I2C protocol. Sensors can have the I2C
addresses 0x44 or 0x45, depending on the wiring. See
Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for methods to instantiate the device.

There are two options configurable by means of sht3x_platform_data:
1. blocking (pull the I2C clock line down while performing the measurement) or
   non-blocking mode. Blocking mode will guarantee the fastest result but
   the I2C bus will be busy during that time. By default, non-blocking mode
   is used. Make sure clock-stretching works properly on your device if you
   want to use blocking mode.
2. high or low accuracy. High accuracy is used by default and using it is
   strongly recommended.

The sht3x sensor supports a single shot mode as well as 5 periodic measure
modes, which can be controlled with the frequency sysfs interface.
The allowed frequencies are as follows:
  *     0  single shot mode
  *   500   0.5 Hz periodic measurement
  *  1000   1   Hz periodic measurement
  *  2000   2   Hz periodic measurement
  *  4000   4   Hz periodic measurement
  * 10000  10   Hz periodic measurement

While in periodic measure mode, read out of humidity and temperature values are
not supported. Nevertheless it is possible to read out the values with maximal
the same frequency as the periodic measure mode.
