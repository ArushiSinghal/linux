Kernel driver xgene-hwmon
========================

Supported chips:
 * APM X-Gene SoC

Description
-----------

This driver adds hardware temperature and power reading support for
APM X-Gene SoC's using the mailbox communication interface.
For device tree, it is the standard DT mailbox.
For ACPI, it is the PCC mailbox.

The following sensors are supported

  * Temperature
    - SoC on-die temperature in milli-degree
    - Alarm when high/over temperature occurs
  * Power
    - CPU power in uW
    - IO power in uW
    - CPU and IO power in uW

sysfs-Interface
---------------

temp1_input - SoC on-die temperature (milli-degree C)
temp1_critical_alarm - An 1 would indicates on-die temperature exceeded threshold
power1_input - CPU power in (uW)
power2_input - IO power in (uW)
power3_input - CPU and IO power in (uW)
