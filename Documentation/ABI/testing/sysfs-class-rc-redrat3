What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/length_fuzz
Date:		Jul 2016
KernelVersion:	4.8
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <m.chehab@samsung.com>
Description:
		The redrat3 encodes an IR signal as set of different lengths
		and a set of indices into those lengths. Writing this file
		sets how much two lengths must differ before they are
		considered distinct, the value is specified in microseconds.
		Default 5, value 0 to 127.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/min_pause
Date:		Jul 2016
KernelVersion:	4.8
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <m.chehab@samsung.com>
Description:
		When receiving a continuous ir stream (for example when a user
		is holding a button down on a remote), this specifies the
		minimum size of a space when the redrat3 sends a irdata packet
		to the host. Specified in miliseconds. Default value 18ms.
		The value can be between 2 and 30 inclusive.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/periods_measure_carrier
Date:		Jul 2016
KernelVersion:	4.8
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <m.chehab@samsung.com>
Description:
		The carrier frequency is measured during the first pulse of
		the IR signal. The larger the number of periods used To
		measure, the more accurate the result is likely to be, however
		some signals have short initial pulses, so in some case it
		may be necessary for applications to reduce this value.
		Default 8, value 1 to 255.
