Description:
		This file is designed for users to check the state of a
		USB3 debug port. On a machine which supports USB3 debug
		port, this file will be created. Reading this file will
		show the state (disabled, enabled or configured) of the
		debug port. On a machine that doesn't support USB3 debug
		port, this file doesn't exist.

		The state of a debug port could be:
		1) disabled: The debug port is not enabled and the root
			port has been switched to xHCI host as a normal
			root port.
		2) enabled: The debug port is enabled. The debug port
			has been assigned to debug capability. The debug
			capability is able to handle the control requests
			defined in USB3 spec.
		3) configured: The debug port has been enumerated by the
			debug host as a debug device. The debug port is
			in use now.
