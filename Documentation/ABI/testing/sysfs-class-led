What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/brightness
Date:		March 2006
KernelVersion:	2.6.17
Contact:	Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>
Description:
		Set the brightness of the LED. Most LEDs don't
		have hardware brightness support so will just be turned on for
		non-zero brightness settings. The value is between 0 and
		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_brightness.
		If a driver uses the RGB LED feature then this attribute is
		interpreted as a HSV color model value:
		<0000000F><HHHHHHHH><SSSSSSSS><VVVVVVVV>
		Usage of the least byte is identical to monochrome mode.
		Saturation can be 0-255 and hue 0-251 (Colour circle is mapped
		to 0-252). If hue and saturation both are 0 the current colour
		is preserved and only the brightness is set. This ensures
		backwards compatibility with monochrome mode, e.g. for
		led_set_brightness() calls from triggers.
		Flag F enables setting hue and saturation even if both are 0.
		For details and examples see Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_brightness
Date:		March 2006

Description:
		Maximum brightness level for this led, default is 255 (LED_FULL).

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/trigger
Date:		March 2006
KernelVersion:	2.6.17
Contact:	Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>
Description:
		Set the trigger for this LED. A trigger is a kernel based source
		of led events.
		You can change triggers in a similar manner to the way an IO
		scheduler is chosen. Trigger specific parameters can appear in
		/sys/class/leds/<led> once a given trigger is selected.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/inverted
Date:		January 2011
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>
Description:
		Invert the LED on/off state. This parameter is specific to
		gpio and backlight triggers. In case of the backlight trigger,
		it is useful when driving a LED which is intended to indicate
		a device in a standby like state.
