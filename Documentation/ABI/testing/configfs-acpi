What:		/config/acpi/table
Date:		April 2016
KernelVersion:	4.6
Description:

		This group contains the configuration for user defined ACPI
		tables. The attributes of a user define table are:

		data - a binary write only attribute that the user can use to
		       fill in the ACPI aml definitions. Once the aml data is
		       written to this file and the file is closed the table
		       will be loaded and ACPI device will be enumerated. To
		       check if the operation is successful the user must check
		       the error code for close(). If the operation is
		       successful, subsequent writes to this attribute will fail.
