Description:	MIPS VPE remoteproc start

	This node only exists when a VPE is considered offline by Linux. Writes
	to this file will start firmware running on a VPE.

	If the VPE is idle, specifying a name will cause a remoteproc instance
	to be allocated, which will cause the core to be stolen, the firmware
	image to be loaded, and the remoteproc instance to be started.
	Otherwise, the operation will fail.

Description:	MIPS VPE remoteproc stop

	This node only exists when a VPE is considered offline by Linux. Writes
	to this file will stop firmware running on a VPE.

	If the VPE is running a remote proc instance, the instance will be
	stopped, the core returned, and the instance freed.
	Otherwise, the operation will fail.
