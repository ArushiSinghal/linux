Date:		Nov. 2015
KernelVersion:	4.9
Contact:	Stephen Hemminger <sthemmin@microsoft.com>
Description:
		Writing a device location to this file will cause
		the driver to attempt to bind to the device found at
		this location.	This is useful for overriding default
		bindings.  The format is UUID format similar to
		/sys/bus/vmbus/devices/. For example:
		# echo f8615163-df3e-46c5-913f-f2d2f965ed0e > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/foo/bind
