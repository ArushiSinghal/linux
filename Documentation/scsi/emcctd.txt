BASICS

Its a client driver implementation for EMC-Symmetrix GuestOS emulated
Cut-Through Device. The Cut-Through Device PCI emulation is implemented for
GuestOS environments in the HyperMax OS. GuestOS environments allows loading of
any x86 compliant operating systems like Linux/FreeBSD etc.

The client driver is a SCSI HBA implementation which interfaces with SCSI
midlayer in the north-bound interfaces and connects with the emulated PCI device
on the south side.

The PCI vendor ID:product ID for emulated Cut-Through Device is 0x1120:0x1B00.

VERSIONING

The Version of the driver is maintained as 2.0.0.X, where 2 refers to the CTD
protocol in use, and X refers to the ongoing version of the driver.


SYSFS SUPPORT

The driver creates the directory /sys/module/emcctd and populates it with
version file and a directory for various parameters as described in MODULE
PARAMETERS section.

PROCFS SUPPORT

The driver creates the directory /proc/emc and creates files emcctd_stats_x
where 'x' refers to the PCI emulation number this client driver connected to.
These files cotains WWN information and IO statistics for the particular PCI
emulation.

MODULE PARAMETERS

The supported parameters which could add debuggability or change the runtime
behavior of the driver are as following:

ctd_debug=0 | 1		Enable driver debug messages(0=off, 1=on)

max_luns=xx		Specify the maximum number of LUN's per
			host(default=16384)

cmd_per_lun=xx		Specify the maximum commands per lun(default=16)

DEBUGGING HINTS

Debugging code is now compiled in by default but debugging is turned off
with the kernel module parameter debug_flag defaulting to 0.  To enable debug at
module load time add ctd_debug=1 to the module load options.
Debugging can also be enabled and disabled by writing a '0' (disable) or '1'
(enable) to the sysfs file /sys/module/emcctd/parameters/ctd_debug
