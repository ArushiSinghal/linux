tcm_qla2xxx jam_host attribute
------------------------------
There is now a new module endpoint atribute called jam_host
attribute: jam_host: boolean=0/1
This attribute and accompanying code is only included if the
Kconfig parameter TCM_QLA2XXX_DEBUG is set to Y
By default this jammer code and functionality is disabled

Use this attribute to control the discarding of SCSI commands to a
selected host.
This may be useful for testing error handling and simulating slow drain
and other fabric issues.

Setting a boolean of 1 for the jam_host attribute for a particular host
 will discard the commands for that host.
Reset back to 0 to stop the jamming.

Enable host 4 to be jammed
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_host

Disable jamming on host 4
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_host

New feature added with a new attribute called jam_data.

Setting a boolean of 1 for jam_data will allow the allow the dropping of data-only SCSI 
 commands but allow TUR commands to pass.
Note that for this to work jam_host needs to be set to 0

This has proven very useful for testing Low Level driver response.

Enable host 4 for only data commands to be jammed
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_host
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_data

Disable jamming on host 4
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_host
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/qla2xxx/21:00:00:24:ff:27:8f:ae/tpgt_1/attrib/jam_data
