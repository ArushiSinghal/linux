---------------
N is the wiper number (0 = first wiper, 1 = second wiper)

File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../decr_wiperN
Mode:	Write
Description:
	Write anything to this file to decrease wiper N position by one step.
Example:
	echo > decr_wiper0


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../incr_wiperN
Mode:	Write
Description:
	Write anything to this file to increase wiper N position by one step.
Example:
	echo > incr_wiper0


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../memory_map
Mode:	Read/Write
Description:
	Read the whole memory or write value to given memory address.
	Read outputs two columns. First column is address and second column is
	value at that address.
	For write use hex values with leading 0x. First hex is address second
	hex is the value.
Example:
	cat memory_map
	echo "0x00 0x80" > memory_map


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../nv_wiperN
Mode:	Read/Write
Description:
	Read or write to non volatile memory of wiper N.
	Read outputs decimal value that corresponds to wiper position.
	For write use decimal value that corresponds to wiper position.
Example:
	cat nv_wiper0
	echo "128" > nv_wiper0


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../out_resistance_scale
Mode:	Read
Description:
	Read the resistance scale of one step (in ohms).
Example:
	cat out_resistance_scale


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../out_resistanceN_raw
Mode:	Read/Write
Description:
	Read or write to volatile memory of wiper N.
	Read outputs decimal value that corresponds to wiper position.
	For write use decimal value that corresponds to wiper position.
Example:
	cat out_resistance0_raw
	echo "128" > out_resistance0_raw


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../status_register
Mode:	Read
Description:
	Read status register.
	Read outputs content in binary format.
Example:
	cat status_register


File:	/sys/bus/iio/devices/../tcon_register
Mode:	ead/Write
Description:
	Read or write to tcon register.
	Read outputs content in binary format.
	For write use binary format string.
Example:
	cat tcon_register
	echo "111111100" > tcon_register
