If you are reading this, because you are adding support for a new
PXA27X board, please note that you should not create an additional
defconfig in arch/arm/configs.

Instead, please update arch/arm/configs/pxa27x-dt_defconfig so that
a kernel built with this config after `make olddefconfig` boots your
board.
