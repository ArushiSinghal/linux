Broadcom STB AVS CPUfreq driver
===============================

"AVS" is the name of a firmware developed at Broadcom. It derives its
name from the technique called "Adaptive Voltage Scaling". Adaptive
voltage scaling was the original purpose of this firmware. The AVS
firmware still supports "AVS mode", where all it does is adaptive
voltage scaling. However, on some newer Broadcom SoCs, the AVS
Firmware, despite its unchanged name, also supports DFS mode and DVFS
mode.

In the context of this document and the related driver, "AVS" by itself
always means the Broadcom firmware and never refers to the technique
called "Adaptive Voltage Scaling".

The Broadcom STB AVS CPUfreq driver provides voltage and frequency
scaling on Broadcom SoCs using AVS firmware with support for DFS and
DVFS. The AVS firmware is running on its own co-processor. The driver
supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)
systems which share clock and voltage across all CPUs.

Actual voltage and frequency scaling is done solely by the AVS firmware.
This driver does not change frequency or voltage itself. It provides a
standard CPUfreq interface to the rest of the kernel and to userland. It
interfaces with the AVS firmware to effect the requested changes and to
report back the current system status in a way that is expected by existing
tools.
