Additional sysfs attribute for acpi-cpufreq

In addition to the standard sysfs interface as defined in the
user-guide.txt under section "Preferred Interface: sysfs",
acpi-cpufreq can have following additional sysfs attribute:

base_frequency: 	Max non-turbo frequency
For example:
scaling_available_frequencies displays list of available frequencies which
can be used to set max/min or current scaling frequency.
>cat scaling_available_frequencies
2301000 2300000 2200000 2000000 1900000 1800000 1700000 1500000 1400000
1300000 1100000 1000000 900000 800000 600000 500000
If the base_frequency attribute is present, then any frequency above is
purely opportunistic or turbo frequency. For example
>cat base_frequency
2200000
Then in the above displayed list of scaling_available_frequencies, any
frequency 2300000 or 2301000 is opportunistic or turbo frequency.
