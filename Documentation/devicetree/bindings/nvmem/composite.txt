= NVMEM cell compositor =

This binding is designed to provide a way for a developer to combine
portions of other NVMEM cell and acces that data as a signle NVMEM
cell using NVMEM consumer API.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvmem-composite"
- layout: specifies which sources comprise data in nvmem device
  	  format is "<nvmem-cell-phandle offset size>"

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of nvmem-composite, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	composite-nvmem {
		compatible = "nvmem-composite";
		layout = <&another_cell_a 0 2
 			  &another_cell_b 0 1
			  &another_cell_c 3 2>;

		cell1: cell@0 {
			reg = <0 5>;
		};
	}

the result of reading variable cell1 would be:

[a[0] a[1] b[0] c[3] c[4]],

where a[i], b[i], c[i], represnet i-th bytes of NVMEM cells
another_cell_a, another_cell_b and another_cell_c respectively

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	a-node {
		nvmem-cells = <&cell1>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "some-data";
	};
