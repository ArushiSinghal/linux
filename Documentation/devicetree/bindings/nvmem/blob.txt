= Deviece Tree Embedded Blob As NVMEM Device =

This binding is designed to provide a way for a developer to reference
data, built-in into device tree blob file, as NVMEM provider and acccess
certain portions of that data as NVMEM cells using NVMEM consumer API.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvmem-blob"
- data: specifies data contained in nvmem device

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of nvmem-composite, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	a-blob {
		compatible = "nvmem-blob";
		data = [aa bb cc dd ee];

		cell1: cell@0 {
			reg = <0 5>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	a-node {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&cell1>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "some-data";
	};
