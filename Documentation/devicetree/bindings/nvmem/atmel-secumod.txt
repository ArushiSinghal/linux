= Atmel Secumod device tree bindings =

This binding is intended to represent Atmel's Secumod which is found
in SAMA5D2 and perhaps others.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "atmel,sama5d2-secumod"
- reg: Should contain RAM location and length, followed
       by register location and length of the Secumod controller.

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of secumod, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

    secumod@fc040000 {
            compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-secumod";
            reg = <0xf8044000 0x1420>, <0xfc040000 0x4000>;
            reg-names = "SECURAM", "SECUMOD";
            status = "okay";

            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <1>;
            ranges;

            secram-auto-erasable@0 {
                    reg = <0x0000 0x1000>;
            };
            secram@1000 {
                    reg = <0x1000 0x400>;
            };
            ram@1400 {
                    reg = <0x1400 0x20>;
            };
    };

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

For example:

	ram {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&ram>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "RAM";
	};
