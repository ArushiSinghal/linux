Designated hotplug memory
-------------------------

This binding describes a region of hotplug memory which is not present at boot,
allowing its eventual NUMA associativity to be prespecified.

Required properties:

- compatible
	"ibm,hotplug-aperture"

- reg
	base address and size of the region (standard definition)

- ibm,associativity
	NUMA associativity (standard definition)

Example:

A 2 GiB aperture at 0x100000000, to be part of nid 3 when hotplugged:

	hotplug-memory@100000000 {
		compatible = "ibm,hotplug-aperture";
		reg = <0x0 0x100000000 0x0 0x80000000>;
		ibm,associativity = <0x4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x3>;
	};
