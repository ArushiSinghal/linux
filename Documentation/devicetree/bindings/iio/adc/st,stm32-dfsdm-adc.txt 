STMicroelectronics STM32 DFSDM ADC device driver

STM32 DFSDM ADC is a sigma delta analog-to-digital converter.
It has to be declared in device-tree as a subnode of the DFSDM mfd node.

It has several multiplexed input channels. Conversions can be performed
in single, scan or discontinuous mode. Conversions can be launched in software
or using hardware triggers.
Each instance of the driver uses one filter instance handle by the DFSDM mfd
driver.

DFSDM also offers extra features:
-The analog watchdog feature allows the application to detect if the
 input voltage goes beyond the user-defined, higher or lower thresholds.
-The short circuit detection allows allows the application to detect if the
 input is in CC.
-The clock absence detection allows application to detect if SPI input is clocked.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc".
- reg:		Specifies the DFSDM filter instance.
- #io-channel-cells = <1>: See the IIO bindings section "IIO consumers".
- st,adc-channels:	List of single-ended channels muxed for this ADC.
- st,adc-channel-names:	List of single-ended channels Name.

Optional properties:
- st,adc-channel-types:	Single-ended channel input type. Default value is 0.
			- 0: SPI with data on rising edge (default)
			- 1: SPI with data on falling edge
			- 2: manchester codec, rising edage = logic 0
			- 3: manchester codec, rising edage = logic 1
- st,adc-channel-clk-src: Conversion clock source. default value is 1.
			  - 0: External SPI clocl (CLKIN x)
			  - 1: internal SPI clock (CLKOUT) (default)
			  - 2: internal SPI clock divided by 2 (falling edge).
			  - 2: internal SPI clock divided by 2 (rising edge).
- st,adc-alt-channel: 	  must be defined if Two ADCs are connected on same SPI
			  input.
			  If not set channel n is connected to SPI input n.
			  If set channel n is connected to SPI input n + 1.

Example:
	dfsdm: dfsdm@4400D000 {
		iio_dfsdm0: iio-dfsdm@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
			#io-channel-cells = <1>;
			reg = <0>;
			st,adc-channels = <1>;
			st,adc-channel-names = "in0";
		};
		iio_dfsdm1: iio-dfsdm@1 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
			#io-channel-cells = <1>;
			reg = <1>;
			st,adc-channels = <1>;
			st,adc-channel-names = "in1";
			st,adc-channel-types = <1>;
			st,adc-alt-channel = <1>;
		};
	};
