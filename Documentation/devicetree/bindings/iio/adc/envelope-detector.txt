Bindings for ADC envelope detector using a DAC and a comparator

The DAC is used to find the peak level of an alternating voltage input
signal by a binary search using the output of a comparator wired to
an interrupt pin. Like so:
                          _
                         | \
    input +------>-------|+ \
                         |   \
           .-------.     |    }---.
           |       |     |   /    |
           |    dac|-->--|- /     |
           |       |     |_/      |
           |       |              |
           |       |              |
           |    irq|------<-------'
           |       |
           '-------'

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "envelope-detector"
- io-channels: Channel node of the dac to be used for comparator input.
- io-channel-names: Should be "dac".
- interrupt specification for one client interrupt,
  see ../../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for details.
- interrupt-names: Should be "comp".
- envelope-detector,dac-max: The maximum raw input value for the dac.
- envelope-detector,comp-interval-ms: How long to wait for the comparator
  to trigger before moving on to another DAC level. This interval needs to
  relate to the lowest possible frequency of the above input signal.

Optional properties:
- envelope-detector,inverted: If the input signal is centered around the
  dac-max voltage (instead of zero), this property causes the detector to
  search for the lowest DAC value that does not triggers the comparator
  (instead of the highest). The result is also inverted so that a lower DAC
  reading yields a higher voltage value.


Example:

	&spi {
		dac: ad7303@4 {
			compatible = "adi,ad7303";
			reg = <4>;
			spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
			Vdd-supply = <&vdd_supply>;
			adi,use-external-reference;
			REF-supply = <&vref_supply>;
			#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

	envelope-detector {
		compatible = "envelope-detector";
		io-channels = <&dac 0>;
		io-channel-names = "dac";

		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		interrupt-names = "comp";

		envelope-detector,dac-max = <255>;
		envelope-detector,comp-interval-ms = <50>;
	};
