Industrial IO regulator device driver
-------------------------------------

This document describes the bindings for the iio-regulator - a dummy device
driver representing a physical regulator within the iio framework.

Required properties:

- compatible: must be "iio-regulator"
- vcc-supply: phandle of the regulator this device represents

Example
-------

iio_regulator {
	compatible = "iio-regulator";
	vcc-supply = <&vcc0>;
};
