IIO multiplexer bindings

If a multiplexer is used to select which hardware signal is fed to
e.g. an ADC channel, these bindings describe that situation.

Required properties:
- compatible : "iio-mux"
- io-channels : Channel node of the parent channel that has multiplexed
		input.
- io-channel-names : Should be "parent".
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Required properties for iio-mux child nodes:
- reg : The multiplexer state as described in ../misc/mux-controller.txt

For each iio-mux child, an iio channel will be created whose number will
match the mux controller state.

Example:
	adc-mux {
		compatible = "iio-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		mux-controller {
			compatible = "mux-gpio";

			mux-gpios = <&pioA 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				    <&pioA 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		};

		sync@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};

		in@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};

		system-regulator@2 {
			reg = <2>;
		};
	};
