IIO multiplexer bindings

If a multiplexer is used to select which hardware signal is fed to
e.g. an ADC channel, these bindings describe that situation.

Required properties:
- compatible : "iio-mux"
- io-channels : Channel node of the parent channel that has multiplexed
		input.
- io-channel-names : Should be "parent".
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;
- mux-controls : Mux controller node to use for operating the mux
- channels : List of strings, labeling the mux controller states.

The multiplexer state as described in ../misc/mux-controller.txt

For each non-empty string in the channels property, an iio channel will
be created. The number of this iio channel is the same as the index into
the list of strings in the channels property, and also matches the mux
controller state.

Example:
	mux: mux-controller {
		compatible = "mux-gpio";
		#mux-control-cells = <0>;

		mux-gpios = <&pioA 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
			    <&pioA 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};

	adc-mux {
		compatible = "iio-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		mux-controls = <&mux>;

		channels = "sync", "in", system-regulator";
	};
