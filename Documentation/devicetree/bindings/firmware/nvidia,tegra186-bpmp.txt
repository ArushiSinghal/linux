NVIDIA Tegra Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP)

The BPMP is a specific processor in Tegra chip, which is designed for
booting process handling and offloading the power management tasks from
the CPU. The binding document defines the resources that would be used by
the BPMP firmware driver, which can create the interprocessor
communication (IPC) between the CPU and BPMP.

Required properties:
- name : Should be bpmp
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,tegra<chip>-bpmp"
- mboxes : The phandle of mailbox controller and the channel ID
           See "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/
	   nvidia,tegra186-hsp.txt" and "Documentation/devicetree/
	   bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt" for more details about the generic
	   mailbox controller and mailbox client driver bindings.
- shmem : List of the phandle of the TX and RX shared memory area that
	  the IPC between CPU and BPMP is based on.
- #clock-cells : Should be 1.
- #reset-cells : Should be 1.

The shared memory bindings for BPMP
-----------------------------------

The shared memory area for the IPC TX and RX between CPU and BPMP are
predefined and work on top of sysram, which is a sram inside the chip.

See "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt" for the bindings.

Example:

hsp_top: hsp@03c00000 {
	...
	#mbox-cells = <1>;
};

bpmp@d0000000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp";
	mboxes = <&hsp_mbox HSP_DB_MASTER_BPMP>;
	shmem = <&cpu_bpmp_tx &cpu_bpmp_rx>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};

sysram@30000000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-sysram", "mmio-ram";
	reg = <0x0 0x30000000 0x0 0x50000>;
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <2>;
	ranges = <0 0x0 0x0 0x30000000 0x0 0x50000>;

	cpu_bpmp_tx: bpmp_shmem@4e000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-shmem";
		reg = <0x0 0x4e000 0x0 0x1000>;
	};

	cpu_bpmp_rx: bpmp_shmem@4f000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp-shmem";
		reg = <0x0 0x4f000 0x0 0x1000>;
	};
};
