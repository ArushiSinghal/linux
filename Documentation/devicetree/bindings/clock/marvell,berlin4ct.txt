* Marvell berlin4ct Clock Controllers

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The berlin4ct clock subsystem generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the berlin4ct SoC. The berlin4ct contains 3 clock controller
blocks: pll, gateclk, berlin-clk.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "marvell,berlin-pll" - pll compatible
  - "marvell,berlin4ct-clk" - berlin clk compatible
  - "marvell,berlin4ct-gateclk" - gateclk compatible
- reg: physical base address of the clock controller and length of memory mapped
  region. For pll, the second reg defines the bypass register base address and
  length of memory mapped region.
- #clock-cells: for pll should 0, for gateclk and berlin clk should be 1.
- #bypass-shift: the bypass bit in bypass register.

Example:

syspll: syspll {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin-pll";
	reg = <0xea0200 0x14>, <0xea0710 4>;
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&osc>;
	bypass-shift = /bits/ 8 <0>;
};

clk: clk {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin4ct-clk";
	reg = <0xea0720 0x144>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&syspll>;
};
