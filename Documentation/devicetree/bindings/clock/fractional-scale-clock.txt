Binding for fractional scale clock source.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "fractional-scale-clock".
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock phandle for the clock.
- #clock-cells : shall be set to 1.
- reg : shall be the physical register address for the clock.
- clock-output-names : shall be the name of the clock referenced by derive clock.
- clock-shift: Bit shift of the clock register. Default is 0.
- clock-width: Width of the clock register. Default is 32.
- clock-denom: shall be the denominator value. Default is 2^32.

Optional properties:
- clock-inverted: shall be 1 if the numerator is inverted.
- clock-names : shall be the name of the clock. If missing, use the device name.

Example:
	clock {
		compatible = "fractional-scale-clock";
		clocks = <&parentclk>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0xFFFF0000 0x0 0x10>
		clock-shift = <8>;
		clock-width = <3>;
		clock-denom = <8>;
		clock-inverted = <1>;
	};
