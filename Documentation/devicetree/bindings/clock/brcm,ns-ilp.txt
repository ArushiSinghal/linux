Broadcom Northstar ILP clock
============================

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

This binding is used for ILP clock (sometimes referred as "slow clock")
on Broadcom Northstar devices using Corex-A7 CPU.

This clock is part of PMU (Power Management Unit), a Broadcom's device
handing power-related aspects. Please note PMU contains more subdevices,
ILP is only one of them.

ILP's rate has to be calculated on runtime and it depends on ALP clock
which has to be referenced.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,ns-ilp"
- reg: iomem address range of PMU (Power Management Unit)
- reg-names: "pmu", the only needed & supported reg right now
- clocks: has to reference an ALP clock
- #clock-cells: should be <0>

Example:

pmu@18012000 {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	ranges = <0x00000000 0x18012000 0x00001000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	ilp: ilp@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,ns-ilp";
		reg = <0 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "pmu";
		clocks = <&alp>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "ilp";
	};
};
