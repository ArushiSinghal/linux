Broadcom Northstar ILP clock
============================

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

This binding is used for ILP clock on Broadcom Northstar devices using
Corex-A7 CPU. ILP clock depends on ALP one and has to be calculated on
runtime.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,ns-ilp"
- reg: iomem address range of PMU (Power Management Unit)
- reg-names: "pmu", the only needed & supported reg right now
- clocks: has to reference an ALP clock
- #clock-cells: should be <0>

Example:

ilp: ilp {
	compatible = "brcm,ns-ilp";
	reg = <0x18012000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "pmu";
	clocks = <&alp>;
	#clock-cells = <0>;
};
