Hisilicon PWM controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "hisilicon,hibvt-pwm" and one of the following:
			"hisilicon,hi3516cv300-pwm".
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
 - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock.
 - resets: offset address and offset bit for reset or unreset of the controller.
 - pwm-nums: pwm number of the controller.

Example:
	pwm: pwm@12130000 {                                                                                                                                     
		compatible = "hisilicon,hibvt-pwm";
		reg = <0x12130000 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&crg_ctrl HI3516CV300_PWM_CLK>;
		resets = <&crg_ctrl 0x38 0>;
		pwm-nums = <4>;
	};
