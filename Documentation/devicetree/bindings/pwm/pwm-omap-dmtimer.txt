* OMAP PWM for dual-mode timers

Required properties:
- compatible: Shall contain "ti,omap-dmtimer-pwm".
- ti,timers: phandle to PWM capable OMAP timer. See arm/omap/timer.txt for info
  about these timers.
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.

Optiomal properties:
- ti,prescaler: Should be a value between 0 and 7, see the timers datasheet

Example:
	pwm: omap-pwm {
		compatible = "ti,omap-pwm";
		ti,timers = <&timer9>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};
