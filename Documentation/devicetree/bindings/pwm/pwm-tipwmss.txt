TI SOC based PWM Subsystem

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ti,am33xx-pwmss";
- reg: physical base address and size of the registers map.
- address-cells: Specify the number of u32 entries needed in child nodes.
		  Should set to 1.
- size-cells: specify number of u32 entries needed to specify child nodes size
		in reg property. Should set to 1.
- ranges: describes the address mapping of a memory-mapped bus. Its value
	  should be empty since no address translation is needed between the
	  parent and the child.

Also child nodes should also populated under PWMSS DT node.

Example:
pwmss0: pwmss@48300000 {
	compatible = "ti,am33xx-pwmss";
	reg = <0x48300000 0x10>;
	ti,hwmods = "epwmss0";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	status = "disabled";
	ranges;

	/* child nodes go here */
};
