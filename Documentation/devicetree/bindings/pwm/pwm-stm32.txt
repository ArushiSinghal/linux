STMicroelectronics PWM driver bindings for STM32

Must be a sub-node of STM32 general purpose timer driver

Required parameters:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-pwm"
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0: 		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes
			for PWM module.
			For Pinctrl properties, please refer to [1].

Optional parameters:
- st,breakinput:	Set if the hardware have break input capabilities
- st,breakinput-polarity: Set break input polarity. Default is 0
			 The value define the active polarity:
			  - 0 (active LOW)
			  - 1 (active HIGH)
- st,pwm-num-chan:	Number of available PWM channels.  Default is 0.
- st,32bits-counter:	Set if the hardware have a 32 bits counter
- st,complementary:	Set if the hardware have complementary output channels

Example:
	gptimer1: gptimer1@40010000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-gptimer";
		reg = <0x40010000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 160>;
		clock-names = "clk_int";

		pwm1@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm";
			st,pwm-num-chan = <4>;
			st,breakinput;
			st,complementary;
		};
	};
