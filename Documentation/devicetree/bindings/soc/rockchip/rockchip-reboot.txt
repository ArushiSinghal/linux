Rockchip reboot notifier driver

This driver get reboot mode arguments from userspace
and stores it in special register. Then the bootloader
will read it and take different action according the
argument stored.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rockchip,reboot"
- regmap: this is phandle to the register map node
- offset: offset in the register map for the storage register (in bytes)

Examples:
	reboot {
	   compatible = "rockchip,reboot";
	   regmap = <&pmu>;
	   offset = <0x94>;
	};
