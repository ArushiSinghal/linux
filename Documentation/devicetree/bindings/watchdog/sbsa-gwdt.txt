* SBSA (Server Base System Architecture) Generic Watchdog

The SBSA Generic Watchdog Timer is used to force a reset of the system
after two stages of timeout have elapsed.  A detailed definition of the
watchdog timer can be found in the ARM document: ARM-DEN-0029 - Server
Base System Architecture (SBSA)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should at least contain "arm,sbsa-gwdt".

- reg: Each entry specifies the base physical 64-bit address of a register
  frame and the 64-bit length of that frame; currently, two frames must be
  defined, in this order:
  1: Watchdog control frame
  2: Refresh frame.

- interrupts: At least one interrupt must be defined that will be used as
  the WS0 interrupt.  A WS1 interrupt definition can be provided, but is
  optional.  The interrupts must be defined in this order:
  1: WS0 interrupt
  2: WS1 interrupt

Optional properties
- timeout-sec: To use a timeout value that is different from the driver
  default values, use this property.  If used, at least one timeout value
  (in seconds) must be provided.  A second optional timeout value (in
  seconds) may also be provided and will be used as the pre-timeout value,
  if it is given.

  There are two possible sources for driver default timeout values:
  (1) the driver contains hard-coded default values, or
  (2) module parameters can be given when the module is loaded

  If timeout/pretimeout values are provided when the module loads, they
  will take priority.  Second priority will be the timeout-sec from DTB,
  and third the hard-coded driver values.

Example for FVP Foundation Model v8:

watchdog@2a440000 {
	compatible = "arm,sbsa-gwdt";
	reg = <0x0 0x2a440000 0 0x1000>,
	      <0x0 0x2a450000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 27 4>;
	timeout-sec = <60 30>;
};
