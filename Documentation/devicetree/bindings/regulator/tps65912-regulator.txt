* TPS65912 regulator bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible: "ti,tps65912-regulator"
 - list of regulators provided by this controller, must be named
     after their hardware counterparts: dcdc[1-4] and ldo[1-10]

Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.

Example:

	tps65912_regulator {
		compatible = "ti,tps65912-regulator";

		dcdc1 {
			regulator-name = "vdd_core";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <912000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1144000>;
			regulator-boot-on;
			regulator-always-on;
		};

		ldo1 {
			regulator-name = "ldo1";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
		};
	};
