Bindings for the Generic PWM Regulator
======================================

Currently supports following modes of operation:

Voltage Table:		When in this mode, a voltage table (See below) of
			predefined voltage <=> duty-cycle values must be
			provided via DT. Limitations are that the regulator can
			only operate at the voltages supplied in the table.
			Intermediary duty-cycle values which would normally
			allow finer grained voltage selection are ignored and
			rendered useless.  Although more control is given to
			the user if the assumptions made in continuous-voltage
			mode do not reign true.

Continuous Voltage:	This mode uses the regulator's maximum and minimum
			supplied voltages specified in the
			regulator-{min,max}-microvolt properties to calculate
			appropriate duty-cycle values.  This allows for a much
			more fine grained solution when compared with
			voltage-table mode above.  This solution does make an
			assumption that a %50 duty-cycle value will cause the
			regulator voltage to run at half way between the
			supplied max_uV and min_uV values.

Linear Equal Step:	This modes divides the regulator's maximum and minimum
			supplied voltages into specified equal steps. The
			number of steps must equally divides the PWM periods.
			On this case, step is translated into number of pulse
			in PWM periods and then multiplied by voltage
			selectors number to get the duty cycles of PWM.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be "pwm-regulator"

- pwms:			PWM specification (See: ../pwm/pwm.txt)

Optional properties:
--------------------
For Voltage Table Mode, following properties must be supplied:
- voltage-table: 	Voltage and Duty-Cycle table consisting of 2 cells
			    First cell is voltage in microvolts (uV)
			    Second cell is duty-cycle in percent (%)

For Linear Equal Steps, following properties must be supplied:
- regulator-n-voltages:	Number of voltage steps between regulator's minimum
			and maximum.

NB: To be clear, if voltage-table is provided, then the device will be used
in Voltage Table Mode.  If regulator-n-voltages is provided then the device
will be used in Linear Equal Step Mode. If both properties are not provided,
then the device will be used in Continuous Voltage Mode.

Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding can also be used.
(See: ../regulator/regulator.txt)

Continuous Voltage Example:
	pwm_regulator {
		compatible = "pwm-regulator;
		pwms = <&pwm1 0 8448 0>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1016000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1114000>;
		regulator-name = "vdd_logic";
	};

Voltage Table Example:
	pwm_regulator {
		compatible = "pwm-regulator;
		pwms = <&pwm1 0 8448 0>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1016000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1114000>;
		regulator-name = "vdd_logic";

			      /* Voltage Duty-Cycle */
		voltage-table = <1114000 0>,
				<1095000 10>,
				<1076000 20>,
				<1056000 30>,
				<1036000 40>,
				<1016000 50>;
	};

Linear Equal Step Mode Example:
	pwm-regulator@1 {
		compatible = "pwm-regulator";
		pwms = <&pwm 1 4880>;
		regulator-name = "vdd-gpu";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <710000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1320000>;
		regulator-n-voltages = <62>;
	};
