Bindings for Voltage controlled regulators
==========================================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible		: must be "vctrl-regulator".
- ctrl-supply:		: a phandle for the regulator supplying the control
			  voltage.
- output-voltage-range	: an array of two integer values specifying the range
			  (min/max) of the output voltage. The min/max voltage
			  constraints of the regulator (if specified) must not
			  exceed this range.
- ctrl-voltage-range	: an array of two integer values specifying the range
			  (min/max) of the control voltage. The values of
			  ctrl-voltage-range and output-voltage-range are used
			  for the conversion between output and control voltage.
			  The min/max values of ctrl-voltage-range must specify
			  the control voltage needed to generate the min/max
			  output voltage.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- ovp-threshold-percent	: overvoltage protection (OVP) threshold of the
			  regulator in percent. Some regulators have an OVP
			  circuitry which shuts down the regulator when the
			  actual output voltage deviates beyond a certain
			  margin from the expected value for a given control
			  voltage. On larger voltage decreases this can occur
			  undesiredly since the output voltage does not adjust
			  inmediately to changes in the control voltage. To
			  avoid this situation the vctrl driver breaks down
			  larger voltage decreases into multiple steps, where
			  each step is within the OVP threshold.
- min-slew-down-rate	: Describes how slowly the regulator voltage will decay
			  down in the worst case (lightest expected load).
			  Specified in uV / us (like main regulator ramp rate).
			  This value is required when ovp-threshold-percent is
			  specified.

Example:

	vctrl_reg {
		compatible = "vctrl-regulator";
		regulator-name = "vctrl_reg";

		ctrl-supply = <&ctrl_supply>;

		regulator-min-microvolt = <800000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1500000>;

		output-voltage-range = <800000 1500000>;
		ctrl-voltage-range = <200000 500000>;

		slew-rate = <225>;
		ovp-threshold-percent = <16>;
	};
