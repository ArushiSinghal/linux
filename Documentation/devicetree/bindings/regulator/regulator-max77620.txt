Regulator DT binding for MAX77620 Power management IC from Maxim Semiconductor.

Device has multiple DCDC(sd[0-3] and LDOs(ldo[0-8]). The details of regulator
properties are defined under the sub node "regulators" of parent node.

Please refer file <Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt>
for common regulator bindings used by client.

Following are properties of regulator subnode.

Optional properties:
-------------------
The input supply of regulators are the optional properties on the
regulator node. The input supply of these regulators are provided
through following properties:
in-sd0-supply: Input supply for SD0, INA-SD0 or INB-SD0 pins.
in-sd1-supply: Input supply for SD1.
in-sd2-supply: Input supply for SD2.
in-sd3-supply: Input supply for SD3.
in-ldo0-1-supply: Input supply for LDO0 and LDO1.
in-ldo2-supply: Input supply for LDO2.
in-ldo3-5-supply: Input supply for LDO3 and LDO5
in-ldo4-6-supply: Input supply for LDO4 and LDO6.
in-ldo7-8-supply: Input supply for LDO7 and LDO8.


Optional sub nodes for regulators:
---------------------------------
The subnodes name is the name of regulator and it must be one of:
	sd[0-3], ldo[0-8]

Each sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization
information for that regulator. The definition for each of these
nodes is defined using the standard binding for regulators found at
<Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt>.

Theres is also additional properties for SD/LDOs.
The properties are required to configure SDs/LDOs FPS parameters
when system is in "active" state or in "suspend" state.
Here "active" state means system is UP and working normally.
"suspend" state means system enters into the suspend state.

- maxim,active-fps-source:	     FPS source for the gpios in active state
				     of the GPIO. Valid values are FPS_SRC_0,
				     FPS_SRC_1, FPS_SRC_2 and FPS_SRC_NONE.
				     Absence of this property will leave the pin
				     on default.
- maxim,active-fps-power-up-slot:    Power up slot on given FPS for active state.
				     Valid values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,active-fps-power-down-slot:  Power down slot on given FPS for active
				     state. Valid values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,suspend-fps-source:	     Suspend state FPS source. Valid values are
				     same as maxim,active-fps-source.
- maxim,suspend-fps-power-down-slot: Suspend state power down slot. Valid
				     values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,suspend-fps-power-up-slot:   Suspend state power up slot. Valid values
				     are 0 to 7.
- maxim,disable-active-discharge:    boolean, Disable active discharge.
