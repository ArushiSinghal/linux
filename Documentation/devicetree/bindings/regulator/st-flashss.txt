ST Voltage regulator for FlashSS vsense

This documents the voltage regulator driver which manages the vsense inside the ST flash
sub-system that is used for configuring MMC, NAND, SPI voltages.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Can be "st,vqmmc", "st,vnand" or "st,vspi" because it is shared
			among these devices inside the ST FlashSS.
- regulator-name:	Regulator name.
- reg:			The vsense top config base address in the flashSS hardware.

Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding, in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt can also be used.

Example:

vqmmc_reg: voltage-regulator {
	compatible = "st,vqmmc";
	regulator-name = "vqmmc0";
	/* Control register for the VSENSE Module */
	reg = <0x9061004 0x4>;
	status = "disabled";
	regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
	regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
	regulator-always-on;
};

mmc0: sdhci@09060000 {
	compatible = "st,sdhci-stih407", "st,sdhci";
	status = "disabled";
	reg = <0x09060000 0x7ff>, <0x9061008 0x20>;
	reg-names = "mmc", "top-mmc-delay";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 92 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupt-names = "mmcirq";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mmc0>;
	clock-names = "mmc";
	clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_MMC_0>;
	bus-width = <8>;
	non-removable;
	vqmmc-supply = <&vqmmc_reg>;
};
