* TPS65086 regulator bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "ti,tps65086-regulator".
 - list of regulators provided by this controller, must be named after their
     hardware counterparts: buck[1-6], ldoa[1-3], swa1, swb[1-2], and vtt.

Optional properties:
 - Per-regulator optional properties are defined in regulator.txt.
 - ti,regulator-step-size-25mv	: This is applicable for buck[1,2,6], set this
				  if the regulator is factory set with a 25mv
				  step voltage mapping.
 - ti,regulator-decay		: This is applicable for buck[1-6], set this if
				  the output needs to decay, default is for the
				  output to slew down.

Example:

	regulators {
		compatible = "ti,tps65086-regulator";

		buck1 {
			regulator-name = "vcc1";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1600000>;
			regulator-boot-on;
			ti,regulator-step-size-25mv;
			ti,regulator-decay;
		};

		swa1 {
			regulator-name = "ls1";
			regulator-boot-on;
		};
	};
