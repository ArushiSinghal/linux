Coupled voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible		: Must be "coupled-voltage-regulator".

Optional properties:
- vinX-supply		: Phandle to the regulators it aggregates

Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding defined in
regulator.txt can also be used.

Example:
	vcc_wifi: wifi_reg {
		compatible = "coupled-voltage-regulator";
		regulator-name = "vcc-wifi";
		vin0-supply = <&reg_ldo3>;
		vin1-supply = <&reg_ldo4>;
	};
