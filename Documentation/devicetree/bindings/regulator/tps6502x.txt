TPS6502x family of regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,tps65020", "ti,tps65021" or "ti,tps65023"
- reg: I2C slave address
- regulators: list of regulators provided by this controller, must be named
  after their hardware counterparts: dcdc[1-3] and ldo[1-2]
- regulators: This is the list of child nodes that specify the regulator
  initialization data for defined regulators. Not all regulators for the given
  device need to be present. The definition for each of these nodes is defined
  using the standard binding for regulators found at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

  The valid names for regulators are:
  tps6502x: dcdc1, dcdc2, dcdc3, ldo1 and ldo2

Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.

Example:

	tps: tps@48 {
		compatible = "ti,tps65023";

		regulators {
			vdcdc1_reg: regulator@0 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_core";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
			vdcdc2_reg: regulator@1 {
				regulator-name = "vddshv";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
			vdcdc3_reg: regulator@2 {
				regulator-name = "vdds";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
			vldo1_reg: regulator@3 {
				regulator-name = "vdda1p8v_usbphy";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
			vldo2_reg: regulator@4 {
				regulator-name = "vdda3p3v_usbphy";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};
		};
	};
