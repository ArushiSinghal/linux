STMicroelectronics STM32 ADFSDM ASoC DAI device driver.

STM32 ADFSDM ASoC is a sigma delta audio interface for digital microphone.
It has to be declared in device-tree as a subnode of the DFSDM mfd node.

It offers possibility to record several mono microphones, with an option to
synchronize all microphones on a main one (that must be piped to filter 0)
Audio interface can be exposed through the generic ASoC simple card.

2 Dmics can be connected on one SPI interface instance n.
Convention is that the DMIC that strobes data on rising edge is connected to the
corresponding DFSDM channel n; while the Dmic that strobes data on falling edge
is connected to the channel n-1. Simple card property "bitclock-inversion = <1>"
is used to specify that microphone strobes data on falling edge.

SPI interface allows to be scheduled by an external SPI clock. To use it
simple card properties "bitclock-master = <&codec>" and "system-clock-frequency"
have to be defined in dai-link node.

Required properties:
- compatible: 	Must be "st,stm32-dfsdm-audio",
- reg:		Specifies the DFSDM filter instance.
- interrupts: 	DFSDM filter instance interrupt line.
- dma:		DMA controller phandle and DMA request line associated to the
		filter instance ( specified by the field "reg")
- dma-names: 	must be "rx"

- st,input-id:		Id of the SPI/Manchester interface used.
- st,dai-filter-order:  SinC filter order from 0 to 5.
			0: FastSinC
			[1-5]: order 1 to 5.
			For audio purpose it is recommended to use order 3 to 5.

Optional properties:
 - st,dai0-synchronized: Set to 1 to synchronize DAI with DFSDM instance 0.

Exemple of a card with 2 Dmics synchronized and connected on SPI interface 1.
