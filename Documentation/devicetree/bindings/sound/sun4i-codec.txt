* Allwinner A10 Codec

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun4i-a10-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun7i-a20-codec"
- reg: must contain the registers location and length
- interrupts: must contain the codec interrupt
- dmas: DMA channels for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain followings:
   - "apb": the parent APB clock for this controller
   - "codec": the parent module clock

Optional properties:
- allwinner,pa-gpios: gpio to enable external amplifier

Required properties for "allwinner,sun6i-a31-codec":
- allwinner,audio-routing: A list of the connections between audio components.
			   Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			   connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			   source. Valid names include:

			   Audio pins on the SoC:
			   "HP"
			   "LINEIN"
			   "LINEOUT"
			   "MIC1"
			   "MIC2"
			   "MIC3"

			   Microphone biases from the SoC:
			   "HBIAS"
			   "MBIAS"

			   Board connectors:
			   "Headphone"
			   "Headset Mic"
			   "Line In"
			   "Line Out"
			   "Mic"
			   "Speaker"

Example:
codec: codec@01c22c00 {
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun7i-a20-codec";
	reg = <0x01c22c00 0x40>;
	interrupts = <0 30 4>;
	clocks = <&apb0_gates 0>, <&codec_clk>;
	clock-names = "apb", "codec";
	dmas = <&dma 0 19>, <&dma 0 19>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	allwinner,pa-gpios = <&pio 7 22 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH22 */
	allwinner,audio-routing =
		"Headphone", "HP",
		"Speaker", "LINEOUT",
		"LINEIN", "Line In",
		"MIC1",	"MBIAS",
		"MIC1", "Mic",
		"MIC2", "HBIAS",
		"MIC2", "Headset Mic";
};
