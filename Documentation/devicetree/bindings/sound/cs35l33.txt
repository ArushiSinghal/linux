CS35L33 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l33"

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios : gpio used to reset the amplifier

  - interrupt-parent : Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to
    which the IRQs from CS35L33 are delivered to.
 -  interrupts : IRQ line info CS35L33.
    (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
    for further information relating to interrupt properties)

  - boost-ctl : Booster voltage use to supply the amp. If the value is
    0, then VBST = VP. If greater than 0, the boost voltage will be 3.3V with
    a value of 1 and will increase at a step size of 0.1V until a maximum of
    8.0V.

  - ramp-rate : On power up, it affects the time from when the power
    up sequence begins to the time the audio reaches a full-scale output.
    On power down, it affects the time from when the power-down sequence
    begins to when the amplifier disables the PWM outputs. If this property
    is not set then soft ramping will be disabled and ramp time would be
    20ms. If this property is set to 0,1,2,3 then ramp times would be 40ms,
    60ms,100ms,175ms respectively for 48KHz sample rate.

  - boost-ipk : The maximum current allowed for the boost converter.
    The range starts at 1.85A (0xF0) and goes to a maximum of 3.60A (0xE0)
    with a step size of 0.015625A. The default is 2.50A (0x90).

  - hg-algo : Parameters for internal Class H/G algorithm that
    controls the amplifier supplies.

Example:

cs35l33: cs35l33@40 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l33";
	reg = <0x40>;

	VA-supply = <&ldo5_reg>;
	VP-supply = <&ldo5_reg>;

	interrupt-parent = <&gpio8>;
	interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	reset-gpios = <&cs47l91 34 0>;

	ramp-rate = <0x0>;
	boost-ctl = <0x30>;  /* VBST = 8.0V */
	boost-ipk = <0xE0>; /* 3.60A */

	hg-algo {
		mem-depth = <0x3>;
		release-rate = <0x3>;
		hd-rm = <0xA>;
		ldo-thld = <0x1>;
		ldo-path-disable = <0x0>;
		ldo-entry-delay=<0x4>;
		vp-hg-auto;
		vp-hg=<0xF>;
		vp-hg-rate=<0x2>;
		vp-hg-va=<0x0>;
	};
};
