Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8958 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		   : "fsl,imx-audio-wm8958"

  - model		   : The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - cpu-dai		   : The phandle of an CPU DAI controller

  - audio-codec		   : The phandle of the WM8958 audio codec

  - audio-routing	   : A list of the connections between audio components.
			     Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being
			     the connection's sink, the second being the
			     connection's source. Valid names could be power
			     supplies, WM8958 pins, and the jacks on the board:

			     Power supplies:
			      * MICBIAS1
			      * MICBIAS2

			     Board connectors:
			      * Headphone Jack
			      * Ext Spk

 - aifx-format             : set format for aifx, such as "i2s", "left_j",
			     "dsp_a", "dsp_b".

 - aifx-bitclock-master    : If present, aifx wroks as bit clock master.
			     Otherwise, aifx works as bit clock slave.

 - aifx-frame-master	   : If present, aifx wroks as frame clock master.
			     Otherwise, aifx works as frame clock slave.

 - aifx-bitclock-inversion : If present, bit clock will invert polarity.

 - aifx-frame-inversion	   : If present, frame clock will invert polarity.

 - aifx-continuous-clock   : If present, bit clock will be continuous.
			     Otherwise, dai bit clocks can be be gated
			     (disabled) when the dai is not sending or
			     receiving PCM data in a frame.

Optional properties:

- hp-det-gpios		   : set headphone detected gpio for sound card.
