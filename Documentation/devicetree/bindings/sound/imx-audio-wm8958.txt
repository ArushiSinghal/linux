Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8958 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		   : "fsl,imx-audio-wm8958"

  - model		   : The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - audio-codec            : The phandle of the WM8958 audio codec

  - audio-routing	   : A list of the connections between audio components.
			     Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being
			     the connection's sink, the second being the
			     connection's source. Valid names could be power
			     supplies, WM8958 pins, and the jacks on the board:

			     Power supplies:
			      * MICBIAS1
			      * MICBIAS2

			     Board connectors:
			      * Headphone Jack
			      * Ext Spk

Optional properties:

 - cpu-dai1		   : The phandle of CPU DAI1 controller, which is for
			     aif1 of wm8958. At least one cpu dai is required.

 - cpu-dai2                : The phandle of CPU DAI2 controller, which is for
			     aif2 of wm8958. At least one cpu dai is required.

 - cpu-dai3                : The phandle of CPU DAI3 controller, which is for
			     aif3 of wm8958. At least one cpu dai is required.

 - dai-link1-name	   : If present, set the dai link1 name and stream name
			     to the specific strings. Otherwise, set the dai
			     link1 name and stream name to "AIF1-DAI".

 - dai-link2-name	   : If present, set the dai link2 name and stream name
			     to the specific strings. Otherwise, set the dai
			     link2 name and stream name to "AIF2-DAI".

 - dai-link3-name          : If present, set the dai link3 name and stream name
			     to the specific strings. Otherwise, set the dai
			     link3 name and stream name to "AIF3-DAI".

 - fsl,cpu-dai1-master   : If present, cpu dai1 works as master, and will
			   provide bit clock and frame clock. Otherwise,
			   cpu dai1 works as slave.
