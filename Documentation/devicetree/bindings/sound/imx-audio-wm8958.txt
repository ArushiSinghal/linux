Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8958 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		   : "fsl,imx-audio-wm8958"

  - model		   : The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - cpu-dai		   : The phandle of an CPU DAI controller

  - audio-codec		   : The phandle of the WM8958 audio codec

  - audio-routing	   : A list of the connections between audio components.
			     Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being
			     the connection's sink, the second being the
			     connection's source. Valid names could be power
			     supplies, WM8958 pins, and the jacks on the board:

			     Power supplies:
			      * MICBIAS1
			      * MICBIAS2

			     Board connectors:
			      * Headphone Jack
			      * Ext Spk

 - fsl,hifi-dai-master   : If present, hifi dai works as master, and will
			   provide bit clock and frame clock. Otherwise,
			   hifi dai works as slave.

Example:

sound {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6ul-evk-wm8958",
			   "fsl,imx-audio-wm8958";
		model = "wm8960-audio";
		cpu-dai = <&sai1>;
		audio-codec = <&codec>;
		audio-routing =
			"Headphone Jack", "HPOUT1L",
			"Headphone Jack", "HPOUT1R",
			"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTLP",
			"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTLN",
			"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTRP",
			"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTRN",
			"IN1LN", "MICBIAS2";

		fsl,hifi-dai-master;
};
