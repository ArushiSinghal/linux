Analog Devices ADAU1361/ADAU1461/ADAU1761/ADAU1961/ADAU1381/ADAU1781

Required properties:

 - compatible:		Should contain one of the following:
			"adi,adau1361"
			"adi,adau1461"
			"adi,adau1761"
			"adi,adau1961"
			"adi,adau1381"
			"adi,adau1781"
 - reg:			The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
			and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Optional properties:

 - input-differential	bool to set if the input is differential
 - digital-microphone	bool to set if there is a digital microphone connected
			to the digmic/jackdet pin.
 - micbias-vg		Microphone bias voltage
	MICBIAS_0_90_AVDD - 0.9 * AVDD
	MICBIAS_0_65_AVDD - 0.65 * AVDD

Optional properties (ADAU1361/ADAU1461/ADAU1761/ADAU1961 only)

 - jack-detection	If present, configures codec to use the digmic/jackdet
			pin for jack detection. must provide one of
			JACKDETECT_ACTIVE_LO or JACKDETECT_ACTIVE_HI followed
			by debounce time in ms, which must be 5, 10, 20, or 40.

 - lineout-mode		Set output mode of the lineout pins.
 - headphone-mode	Set output mode of the headphone pins.

The output mode must be one of:
	OUTPUT_MODE_HEADPHONE           - Headphone output
	OUTPUT_MODE_HEADPHONE_CAPLESS   - Capless headphone output
	OUTPUT_MODE_LINE                - Line output



Example:
#include <dt-bindings/sound/adau17x1.h>

	i2c_bus {
		adau1361@38 {
			compatible = "adi,adau1361";
			reg = <0x38>;
			input-differential;
			jack-detection = <JACKDETECT_ACTIVE_LO 40>;
			lineout-mode = <OUTPUT_MODE_LINE>;
			headphone-mode = <OUTPUT_MODE_HEADPHONE>;
			micbias-vg = <MICBIAS_0_90_AVDD>;
		};
	};
