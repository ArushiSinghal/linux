DesignWare I2S controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be "snps,designware-i2s"
 - reg : Must contain the I2S core's registers location and length
 - interrupts: <IRQ> where IRQ is the interrupt number.
 - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the controller's
   clocks. The controller expects one clock: the clock used as the sampling
   rate reference clock sample.
 - clock-names : "i2sclk" for the sample rate reference clock.

Optional properties:
 - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the DMA channels that are used by
   the core. The core expects one or two dma channels: one for transmit and
   one for receive. Set this parameter if the I2S DMA block is enabled.
 - dma-names : "tx" for the transmit channel, "rx" for the receive channel. Set
   this parameter if the I2S DMA block is enabled.

Example:

	soc_i2s: i2s@7ff90000 {
		compatible = "snps,designware-i2s";
		reg = <0x0 0x7ff90000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <15>;
		clocks = <&scpi_i2sclk 0>;
		clock-names = "i2sclk";
		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
		dmas = <&dma0 5>;
		dma-names = "tx";
	};
