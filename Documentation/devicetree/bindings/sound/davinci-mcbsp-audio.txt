Texas Instruments DaVinci McBSP module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This binding describes the "Multi-channel Buffered Serial Port" (McBSP)
audio interface found in some TI DaVinci processors like e.g. the DA850,
DM6446, DA355.


Required properties:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- compatible : "ti,da850-mcbsp-audio"

- reg : physical base address and length of the controller memory mapped
        region(s).
- reg-names : Should contain:
         * "mpu" for the main registers (required). For compatibility with
           existing software, it is recommended this is the first entry.
         * "dat" for the data FIFO (optional).

- dmas: two element list of DMA controller phandles and DMA request line
        ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
	     These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas. The dma
	     identifiers must be "rx" and "tx".

Optional properties:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- interrupts : Interrupt numbers for McBSP
- interrupt-names : Known interrupt names are "rx" and "tx"

- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control group used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default", for more details
  		 please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt

- channel-combine : boolean. If present L and R channels are combined into one
		DMA transfer, however the labelling of the channels is swapped.
		Therefore this option should be used only if the channels can
		be swapped back at the codec side again.

Example (AM1808):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mcbsp0: mcbsp@1d10000 {
	compatible = "ti,davinci-mcbsp-audio";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mcbsp0_pins>;

	reg = 	<0x00110000 0x1000>,
		<0x00310000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "mpu", "dat";
	interrupts = <97 98>;
	interrupts-names = "rx", "tx";
	dmas = <&edma0 3
		&edma0 2>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	status = "okay";
};
