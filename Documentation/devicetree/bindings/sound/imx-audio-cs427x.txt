Freescale i.MX audio complex with CS4271 or CS4272 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-cs427x"

  - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - ssi-controller	: The phandle of the i.MX SSI controller

  - audio-codec	: The phandle of the CS4271 audio codec

  - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			  source. Valid names could be power supplies, CS427x
			  pins, and the jacks on the board:

			  Board connectors:
			   * Mic Jack
			   * Headphone Jack

  - mux-int-port	: The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)

  - mux-ext-port	: The external port of the i.MX audio muxer

Note: The AUDMUX port numbering should start at 1, which is consistent with
hardware manual.

Example:

sound {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6-rex-cs427x",
		"fsl,imx-audio-cs427x";
	model = "audio-cs427x";
	ssi-controller = <&ssi1>;
	audio-codec = <&cs4271>;
	audio-routing =
		"Mic Jack", "AINA",
		"Mic Jack", "AINB",
		"Headphone Jack", "AOUTA+",
		"Headphone Jack", "AOUTA-",
		"Headphone Jack", "AOUTB+",
		"Headphone Jack", "AOUTB-";
	mux-int-port = <1>;
	mux-ext-port = <3>;
};
