===================
J-Core cpu bindings
===================

The J-Core processors are open source CPU cores that can be built as FPGA
soft cores or ASICs. The device tree is also responsible for describing the
cache controls and, for SMP configurations, all details of the SMP method,
as documented below.


---------------------
Top-level "cpus" node
---------------------

Required properties:

- #address-cells: Must be 1.

- #size-cells: Must be 0.

Optional properties:

- enable-method: Required only for SMP systems. If present, must be
  "jcore,spin-table".


--------------------
Individual cpu nodes
--------------------

Required properties:

- device_type: Must be "cpu".

- compatible: Must be "jcore,j2".

- reg: Must be 0 on uniprocessor systems, or the sequential, zero-based
  hardware cpu id on SMP systems.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency: Clock frequency of the cpu in Hz.

- cpu-release-addr: Necessary only for secondary processors on SMP systems
  using the "jcore,spin-table" enable method. If present, must consist of
  two cells containing physical addresses. The first cell contains an
  address which, when written, unblocks the secondary cpu. The second cell
  contains an address from which the cpu will read its initial program
  counter when unblocked.


---------------------
Cache controller node
---------------------

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "jcore,cache".

- reg: A memory range for the cache controller registers.


--------
IPI node
--------

Device trees for SMP systems must have an IPI node representing the mechanism
used for inter-processor interrupt generation.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "jcore,ipi-controller".

- reg: A memory range used to IPI generation.

- interrupts: An irq on which IPI will be received.


----------
CPUID node
----------

Device trees for SMP systems must have a CPUID node representing the mechanism
used to identify the current processor on which execution is taking place.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "jcore,cpuid-mmio".

- reg: A memory range containing a single 32-bit mmio register which produces
  the current cpu id (matching the "reg" property of the cpu performing the
  read) when read.
