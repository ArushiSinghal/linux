Bindings for Analog Devices ADG792A/G Triple 4:1 Multiplexers

Required properties:
- compatible : "adi,adg792a" or "adi,adg792g"
- #mux-control-cells : <0> if parallel, or <1> if not.
* Standard mux-controller bindings as decribed in mux-controller.txt

Optional properties for ADG792G:
- gpio-controller : if present, #gpio-cells below is required.
- #gpio-cells : should be <2>
			  - First cell is the GPO line number, i.e. 0 or 1
			  - Second cell is used to specify active high (0)
			    or active low (1)

Optional properties:
- adi,parallel : if present, the three muxes are bound together with a single
  mux controller, controlling all three muxes in parallel.
- adi,idle-state : if present, array of 2-tuples with mux controller number
  and state that mux controllers will have when idle. States 0 through 3
  correspond to signals A through D in the datasheet.
- adi,idle-high-impedance : if present, array of mux controller numbers that
  should be in the disconnected high-impedance state when idle.

Mux controller states 0 through 3 correspond to signals A through D in the
datasheet. If a mux controller is mentioned in neither adi,idle-state nor
adi,idle-high-impedance it is left in its previously selected state when idle.

Example:

	/*
	 * Three independent mux controllers (of which one is used).
	 * Mux 0 is disconnected when idle, mux 1 idles with signal C
	 * and mux 2 idles with signal A.
	 */
	&i2c0 {
		mux: adg792a@50 {
			compatible = "adi,adg792a";
			reg = <0x50>;
			#mux-control-cells = <1>;

			adi,idle-high-impedance = <0>;
			adi,idle-state = <1 2>, <2 0>;
		};
	};

	adc-mux {
		compatible = "io-channel-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		mux-controls = <&mux 1>;

		channels = "sync-1", "", "out";
	};


	/*
	 * Three parallel muxes with one mux controller, useful e.g. if
	 * the adc is differential, thus needing two signals to be muxed
	 * simultaneously for correct operation.
	 */
	&i2c0 {
		pmux: adg792a@50 {
			compatible = "adi,adg792a";
			reg = <0x50>;
			#mux-control-cells = <0>;
			adi,parallel;
		};
	};

	diff-adc-mux {
		compatible = "io-channel-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		mux-controls = <&pmux>;

		channels = "sync-1", "", "out";
	};
