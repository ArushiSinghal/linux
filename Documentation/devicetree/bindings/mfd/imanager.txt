Kernel driver imanager
======================

This driver provides a communication layer to the Advantech iManager EC
firmware which is factory loaded onto ITE IT8518/28 chips. The type of
communication is message based. Clients (gpio, i2c, hwmon etc. drivers)
request data from Advantech iManager (polling, not interrupt driven). If
a response is been received within a time frame, the data is been extracted
from the message and then passed to the caller (clients).
