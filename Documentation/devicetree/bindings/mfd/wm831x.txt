Cirrus Logic/Wolfson Microelectronics wm831x PMICs

System PMICs with a wide range of additional features.

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of the following chip-specific strings:
        "wlf,wm8310"
        "wlf,wm8311"
        "wlf,wm8312"
        "wlf,wm8320"
        "wlf,wm8321"
        "wlf,wm8325"
        "wlf,wm8326"

  - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number when
    using SPI.

  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

Example:

wm8310: wm8310@36 {
	compatible = "wlf,wm8310";
	reg = <0x36>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
};
