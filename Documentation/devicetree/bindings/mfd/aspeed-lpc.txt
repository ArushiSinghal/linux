* Device tree bindings for the Aspeed LPC Controller

The Aspeed LPC controller contains registers for a variety of functions. Not
all registers for a function are contiguous, and some registers are referenced
by functions outside the LPC controller.

Note that this is separate from the H8S/2168 compatible register set occupying
the start of the LPC controller address space.

Some significant functions in the LPC controller:

* LPC Host Controller
* Host Interface Controller
* iBT Controller
* SuperIO Scratch registers

Required properties:
- compatible:		"aspeed,ast2500-lpc", "syscon"
- reg:			contains offset/length value of the Aspeed-specific LPC
			memory region.

Example:

lpc: lpc@1e7890a0 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-lpc", "syscon";
	reg = <0x1e789080 0x1e0>;
};
