MAX77620 Power management IC from Maxim Semiconductor.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be one of
		"maxim,max77620"
		"maxim,max20024".
- reg: I2C device address.

Optional properties:
-------------------
- interrupts:		the interrupt on the parent the controller is
			connected to
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells:	is <2> and their usage is compliant to the 2 cells
			variant of <../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt>
			IRQ numbers for different interrupt source of MAX77620
			are defined at dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h.

Optional subnodes and their properties:
=======================================

Flexible power sequence configurations:
--------------------------------------
The PMIC has multiple control mode:
	Normal mode also called as active mode on which all step-down
		regulators, all linear regulators, GPIOs, and the 32kHz
		oscillator are in normal active mode.
	sleep mode: Regulators/GPIOs/clock can go on OFF state based on
		their configurations.
	Global Low power mode (GLPM): In this mode, step-down regulators, linear
		regulators, and the 32kHz oscillator are in low-power modes.

	Different modes of regulators/clock/GPIOs are controlled by the their
FPS configurations. There is different configuration registers for each of
these resources. Typical configurations per resource are:
	FPS source: 	Attach the resource to required FPS source. When
			resources are attached to one of FPS source then
			resournce can be enable/disable when related FPS
			source gets the control signal for ON and OFF.
	Power on slot: 	Slot number on which resource is ON once FPS source
			get ON signal.
	Power down slot Slot number on which resource is OFF once FPS source
			get OFF signal.

There is three FPS source for resources called FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2. All
resources need to attached to one of these FPS. It can alsoi be set
FPS source to NONE, and on this case, it is completely controlled by
the register control rather than external input control to PMIC.

The configuration parameters of FPS is provided through subnode "fps"
and their child for FPS specific.
The node name for FPS child are defined as "fps0", "fps1", and "fps2" for
the FPS0, FPS1 and FPS2 respectively.

There is need for different FPS configuration parameters based on system
state like when system state changed from active to suspend or active to
power off (shutdown).

Optinal properties:
-------------------
-maxim,fps-control:	u32, FPS control source like external control input
			to PMIC i.e. EN0, EN1 or software (SW). The macros
			are defined on dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h for
			different control source.
				FPS_CONTROL_SRC_EN0 for PMIC external input EN0.
				FPS_CONTROL_SRC_EN1 for PMIC external input EN1.
				FPS_CONTROL_SRC_SW for software control.

-maxim,shutdown-fps-time-period-us: u32, FPS time period in microseconds
				    when system enters to shutdown state.
-maxim,suspend-fps-time-period-us:  u32, FPS time period in microseconds
				    when system enters to suspend state.

-maxim,enable-sleep: 		    Boolean, enable sleep state of PMIC
				    when the FPS control input become active.
-maxim,enable-global-lpm: 	    Boolean, enable Global Low Power Mode (GLPM)
				    of PMIC when the FPS control input become
				    active.

Here supported time periods by device in microseconds are as follows:
MAX77620 supports 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560 and 5120 microseconds.
MAX20024 supports 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2540 microseconds.

For different sub modules like GPIO, pincontrol, regulator, power, please refer
respected device-tree binding document on respective directories.

Example:
--------
#include <dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h>

max77620@3c {
	compatible = "maxim,max77620";
	reg = <0x3c>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <0 86 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	fps {
		fps0 {
			maxim,shutdown-fps-time-period-us = <1280>;
			maxim,fps-control = <FPS_CONTROL_SRC_EN1>;
		};

		fps1 {
			maxim,shutdown-fps-time-period-us = <1280>;
			maxim,fps-control = <FPS_CONTROL_SRC_EN0>;
		};

		fps2 {
			maxim,shutdown-fps-time-period-us = <1280>;
			maxim,fps-control = <FPS_CONTROL_SRC_SW>;
		};
	};
};
