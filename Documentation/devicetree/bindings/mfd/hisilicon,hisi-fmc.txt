HiSilicon Flash Memory Controller

The HiSilicon Flash Memory Controller(FMC) is a feature-rich controller
that supports SPI Nor, SPI Nand and Parallel Nand devices. This document
describes the binding for HiSilicon FMC device and its sub-notes.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "hisilicon,hisi-fmc".
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the controller device.
- reg-names : Must include the following two entries: "control", "memory".
- address-cells : Should be 1.
- size-cells : Should be 0.
- clocks : A phandle to the HiSilicon FMC controller clock.

Optional sub-nodes:
	- spi-nor:
	Required properties:
		- compatible : "hisilicon,fmc-spi-nor"
	see "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/hisilicon,fmc-spi-nor.txt

	- spi-nand:
	Required properties:
		- compatible : "hisilicon,fmc-spi-nand"
		- reg : The chipselect for spi-nand devices
		- address-cells : Should be 1.
		- size-cells : Should be 0.

	- nand:
	Required properties:
		- compatible : "hisilicon,fmc-nand"
		- reg : The chipselect for nand devices
		- address-cells : Should be 1.
		- size-cells : Should be 0.

Example:
fmc: flash-memory-controller@10000000 {
		 compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-fmc";
		 reg = <0x10000000 0x1000>, <0x14000000 0x1000000>;
		 reg-names = "control", "memory";
		 clocks = <&crg FMC_CLK>;

		 hisfc:spi-nor {
				   compatible = "hisilicon,fmc-spi-nor";
				   #address-cells = <1>;
				   #size-cells = <0>;
				   hi_sfc@0 {
					   compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
					   reg = <0>;
				   };
				/*
				 * Here you can add the spi nor flash devices.
				 * They share the same spi nor controller, but
				 * have different chipselect.
				 */
		};

		/*
		 * Here you can add spi nand and nand sub-nodes. It depends
		 * on the board-grade design.
		 */

};
