CPCAP PMIC device tree binding

Required properties:
- compatible		: Motorola device "motorola,cpcap", others "st,6556002"
- reg			: Chip select and size
- interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller
- interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to
- interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2
- #address-cells	: Child device offset number of cells, typically 1
- #size-cells		: Child device size number of cells, typically 1
- ranges		: Child device register range
- spi-max-frequency	: Typically set to 3000000
- spi-cs_high		: SPI chip select direction

Example:

&mcspi1 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;
	cpcap: pmic@0 {
		compatible = "motorola,cpcap", "st,6556002";
		reg = <0 0>;	/* cs0, size 0 */
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <7 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0 0 0x8000>;
		spi-max-frequency = <3000000>;
		spi-cs-high;
	};
};
