STM32 General Purpose Timer driver bindings

Required parameters:
- compatible: must be "st,stm32-gptimer"

- reg:			Physical base address and length of the controller's
			registers.
- clock-names: 		Set to "clk_int".
- clocks: 		Phandle to the clock used by the timer module.
			For Clk properties, please refer to ../clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional parameters:
- resets:		Phandle to the parent reset controller.
			See ../reset/st,stm32-rcc.txt

Optional subnodes:
- pwm:			See ../pwm/pwm-stm32.txt
- timer:		See ../iio/timer/stm32-timer-trigger.txt

Example:
	gptimer@40010000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "st,stm32-gptimer";
		reg = <0x40010000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 160>;
		clock-names = "clk_int";

		pwm@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm";
			pinctrl-0	= <&pwm1_pins>;
			pinctrl-names	= "default";
		};

		timer@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer-trigger";
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
