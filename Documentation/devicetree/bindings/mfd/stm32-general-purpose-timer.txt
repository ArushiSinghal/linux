STM32 general purpose timer driver

Required parameters:
- compatible: must be "st,stm32-gptimer"

- reg:			Physical base address and length of the controller's
			registers.
- clock-names: 		Set to "clk_int".
- clocks: 		Phandle to the clock used by the timer module.
			For Clk properties, please refer to ../clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional parameters:
- resets:		Phandle to the parent reset controller.
			See ..reset/st,stm32-rcc.txt

Optional subnodes:
- pwm:			See ../pwm/pwm-stm32.txt
- iiotimer:		See ../iio/timer/stm32-iio-timer.txt

Example:
	gptimer1: gptimer1@40010000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-gptimer";
		reg = <0x40010000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 160>;
		clock-names = "clk_int";

		pwm1@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm";
			st,pwm-num-chan = <4>;
			st,breakinput;
			st,complementary;
		};

		iiotimer1@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-iio-timer";
			interrupts = <27>;
			st,input-triggers-names = TIM5_TRGO,
						  TIM2_TRGO,
						  TIM4_TRGO,
						  TIM3_TRGO;
			st,output-triggers-names = TIM1_TRGO;
		};
	};
