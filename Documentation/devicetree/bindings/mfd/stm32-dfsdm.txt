STMicroelectronics STM32 Digital Filter for Sigma Delta Modulator (DFSDM)
ulti-function device.

The STM32 DFSDM device is a multifunction device that handles the DFSDM IP.

The DFSDM IP allows to add processing on Sigma Delta ADC based on SinC filters.
For this, a pool of m filters can be connected to a pool of n channels.
For STM32H7 : m = 4, n = 8.

Each channel n is assigned to the SPI or Manchester interface n or n + 1.
Channels 0 to 2 can also be connected to ADC IP instance 1 to 3.
Filtering result is stored in a left aligned register, with 8 LSB reserved for
the input channel ID.

Each filter instance supports two contexts to manage conversions, each one has
its own configurable sequence and trigger:
- regular conversion: used for single or continuous conversion.
- injected conversions: used for triggered conversion.

Interfaces supported:
- sigma delta ADCs trough IIO framework.
- PDM microphones through ASoC framework.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "st,stm32h7-dfsdm".
- reg:		Specifies the DFSDM block register address and length.
- interrupts:	IRQ lines connected to each DFSDM filter instance.
- clocks:	IP and serial interfaces clocking. Should be set according
		to rcc clock ID and "clock-names".
- clock-names:	Input clock name "dfsdm_clk" must be defined,
		"audio_clk" is optional. If defined CLKOUT is based on the audio
		clock, else "dfsdm_clk" is used.

Optional properties:
- st,clkout-freq: clkout clock frequency (Hz).This clock must be set according
		  to "clock" property. Frequency must be a multiple of the rcc
		  clock frequency. If not, clkout frequency will not be
		  accurate.
- pinctrl-names:  set to "default".
- pinctrl-0:	  List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes for DFSDM
		  module.

Example :
	dfsdm: dfsdm@4400D000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32h7-dfsdm";
		reg = <0x40017000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <110>, <111>, <112>, <113>;
		clocks = <&timer_clk>;
		clock-names = "dfsdm_clk";
		pinctrl-0 = <&dfsdm_ch0 &dfsdm_ch1>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		st,clkout-freq = <2480000>;

		iio_dfsdm0: iio-dfsdm@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
			#io-channel-cells = <1>;
			reg = <0>;
			status = "disabled";
		};
		dai_dfsdm0: dfsdm-audio@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-audio";
			#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;
			dmas = <&dmamux1 101 0x400 0x00>;
			dma-names = "rx";
			status = "disabled";
		};
	};
