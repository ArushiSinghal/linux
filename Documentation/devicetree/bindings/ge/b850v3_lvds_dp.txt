Driver for GE B850v3 LVDS/DP++ display bridge

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "ge,b850v3_lvds_dp".
  - reg : should contain the address used to ack the interrupts.
  - interrupt-parent : should link to the gpio used as interrupt
    source on the host.
  - interrupts : one interrupt should be described here, as in
    <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>.
  - edid-reg : should contain the address used to read edid information
  - port : should describe the vide signal connection between the host
    and the bridge.

Example:

&mux2_i2c2 {
	status = "okay";
	clock-frequency = <100000>;

	b850v3-lvds-dp-bridge@73  {
		compatible = "ge,b850v3-lvds-dp";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		reg = <0x73>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		edid-reg = <0x72>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			b850v3_dp_bridge_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lvds0_out>;
			};
		};
	};
};
