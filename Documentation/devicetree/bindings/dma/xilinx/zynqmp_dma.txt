Xilinx ZynqMP DMA engine, it does support memory to memory transfers,
memory to device and device to memory transfers. It also has flow
control and rate control support for slave/peripheral dma access.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-dma-1.0"
- reg			: Memory map for gdma/adma module access.
- interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts		: Should contain DMA channel interrupt.
- xlnx,bus-width	: Axi buswidth in bits. Should contain 128 or 64
- clock-names		: List of input clocks "clk_main", "clk_apb"
			  (see clock bindings for details)

Optional properties:
- xlnx,include-sg	: Indicates the controller to operate in simple or
			  scatter gather dma mode
- xlnx,ratectrl		: Scheduling interval in terms of clock cycles for
			  source AXI transaction
- xlnx,overfetch	: Tells whether the channel is allowed to over
			  fetch the data
- xlnx,src-issue	: Number of AXI outstanding transactions on source side
- xlnx,src-burst-len	: AXI length for data read. Support only power of
			  2 byte values.
- xlnx,dst-burst-len	: AXI length for data write. Support only power of
			  2 byte values.
- dma-coherent		: Present if dma operations are coherent.

fpd_dma_chan1: dma@fd500000 {
	compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-dma-1.0";
	reg = <0x0 0xFD500000 0x1000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 117 4>;
	clock-names = "clk_main", "clk_apb";
	xlnx,bus-width = <128>;
	xlnx,include-sg;
	xlnx,overfetch;
	dma-coherent;
	xlnx,ratectrl = <0>;
	xlnx,src-issue = <16>;
	xlnx,src-burst-len = <4>;
	xlnx,dst-burst-len = <4>;
