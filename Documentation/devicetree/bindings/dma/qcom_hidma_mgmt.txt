Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Management interface

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain "qcom,hidma_mgmt"
- reg: Address range for DMA device
- interrupts: Should contain the one interrupt shared by all channels
- nr-channels: Number of channels supported by this DMA controller.
- max-write: Maximum write burst in bytes. A memcpy requested is
  fragmented to multiples of this amount.
- max-read: Maximum read burst in bytes. A memcpy request is
  fragmented to multiples of this amount.
- max-wxactions: Maximum write transactions to perform in a burst
- max-rdactions: Maximum read transactions to perform in a burst
- max-memset-limit: Maximum memset limit
- ch-priority-#n: Priority of the channel
- ch-weight-#n: Round robin weight of the channel
Example:

	hidma-mgmt@f9984000 = {
		compatible = "qcom,hidma_mgmt";
		reg = <0xf9984000 0x15000>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		nr-channels = 6;
		max-write = 1024;
		max-read = 1024;
		max-wxactions = 31;
		max-rdactions = 31;
		max-memset-limit = 8;
		ch-priority-0 = 0;
		ch-priority-1 = 1;
		ch-priority-2 = 1;
		ch-priority-3 = 0;
		ch-priority-4 = 0;
		ch-priority-5 = 0;
		ch-weight-0 = 1;
		ch-weight-1 = 13;
		ch-weight-2 = 10;
		ch-weight-3 = 3;
		ch-weight-4 = 4;
		ch-weight-5 = 5;
	};
