* Synopsys DesignWare AXI DMA Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "snps,axi-dma"
- reg: Address range of the DMAC registers. This should include
  all of the per-channel registers.
- interrupt: Should contain the DMAC interrupt number.
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device.
- dma-channels: Number of channels supported by hardware.
- dma-masters: Number of AXI masters supported by the hardware.
- data-width: Maximum AXI data width supported by hardware.
  (0 - 8bits, 1 - 16bits, 2 - 32bits, ..., 6 - 512bits)
- priority: Priority of channel. Array property. Priority value must be
  programmed within [0:dma-channels-1] range. (0 - minimum priority)
- block-size: Maximum block size supported by the controller channel. Array
  property.

Example:

dmac: dmac@80000 {
	compatible = "snps,axi-dma";
	reg = <0x80000 0x400>;
	clocks = <&core_clk>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <27>;

	dma-channels = <4>;
	dma-masters = <2>;
	data-width = <3>;
	block-size = <4096 4096 4096 4096>;
	priority = <0 1 2 3>;
};
