Marvell's Xenon SDHCI Controller device tree bindings
This file documents differences between the core mmc properties
described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the Xenon implementation.

A single Xenon IP can support multiple slots.
Each slot acts as an independent SDHC. It owns independent resources, such
as register sets clock and PHY.
Each slot should have an independent device tree node.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "marvell,armada-3700-sdhci": For controllers on Armada-3700 SOC.
  Must provide a second register area and marvell,pad-type.
  - "marvell,xenon-sdhci": For controllers on all the SOCs, other than
  Armada-3700.

- clocks:
  Array of clocks required for SDHCI.
  Requires at least one for Xenon IP core.
  Some SOCs require additional clock for AXI bus.

- clock-names:
  Array of names corresponding to clocks property.
  The input clock for Xenon IP core should be named as "core".
  The optional AXI clock should be named as "axi".

- reg:
  * For "marvell,xenon-sdhci", one register area for Xenon IP.

  * For "marvell,armada-3700-sdhci", two register areas.
    The first one for Xenon IP register. The second one for the Armada 3700 SOC
    PHY PAD Voltage Control register.
    Please follow the examples with compatible "marvell,armada-3700-sdhci"
    in below.
    Please also check property marvell,pad-type in below.

Optional Properties:
- marvell,xenon-slotno:
  Indicate the corresponding bit index of current Xenon SDHC slot in
  SDHC System Operation Control Register Bit[7:0].
  Set/clear the corresponding bit to enable/disable current Xenon SDHC
  slot.
  If this property is not provided, Xenon IP should contain only one
  slot.

- marvell,xenon-phy-type:
  Xenon support mutilple types of PHYs.
  To select eMMC 5.1 PHY, set:
  marvell,xenon-phy-type = "emmc 5.1 phy"
  eMMC 5.1 PHY is the default choice if this property is not provided.
  To select eMMC 5.0 PHY, set:
  marvell,xenon-phy-type = "emmc 5.0 phy"
  To select SDH PHY, set:
  marvell,xenon-phy-type = "sdh phy"
  Please note that eMMC PHY is a general PHY for eMMC/SD/SDIO, other than for
  eMMC only.

- marvell,xenon-phy-znr:
  Set PHY ZNR value.
  Only available for eMMC PHY 5.1 and eMMC PHY 5.0.
  valid range = [0:0x1F].
  ZNR is set as 0xF by default if this property is not provided.

- marvell,xenon-phy-zpr:
  Set PHY ZPR value.
  Only available for eMMC PHY 5.1 and eMMC PHY 5.0.
  valid range = [0:0x1F].
  ZPR is set as 0xF by default if this property is not provided.

- marvell,xenon-phy-nr-success-tun:
  Set the number of required consecutive successful sampling points used to
  identify a valid sampling window, in tuning process.
  Valid range = [1:7]. Set as 0x4 by default if this property is not provided.

- marvell,xenon-phy-tun-step-divider:
  Set the divider for calculating TUN_STEP.
  Set as 64 by default if this property is not provided.

- marvell,xenon-phy-slow-mode:
  Force PHY into slow mode.
  Only available when bus frequency lower than 50MHz in SDR mde.
  Disabled by default. Please do not enable it unless it is necessary.

- marvell,xenon-mask-conflict-err:
  Mask Conflict Error alert on some SOC. Disabled by default.

- marvell,xenon-tun-count:
  Xenon SDHC SOC usually doesn't provide re-tuning counter in
  Capabilities Register 3 Bit[11:8].
  This property provides the re-tuning counter.
  If this property is not set, default re-tuning counter will
  be set as 0x9 in driver.

- marvell,pad-type:
  Type of Armada 3700 SOC PHY PAD Voltiage Controller register.
  Only valid when "marvell,armada-3700-sdhci" is selected.
  Two types: "sd" and "fixed-1-8v".
  If "sd" is slected, SOC PHY PAD is set as 3.3V at the beginning and is
  switched to 1.8V when SD in UHS-I.
  If "fixed-1-8v" is slected, SOC PHY PAD is fixed 1.8V, such as for eMMC.
  Please follow the examples with compatible "marvell,armada-3700-sdhci"
  in below.

Example:
- For eMMC slot:

	sdhci@aa0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,xenon-sdhci";
		reg = <0xaa0000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>
		clocks = <&emmc_clk>, <&axi_clock>;
		clock-names = "core", "axi";
		bus-width = <8>;
		marvell,xenon-emmc;
		marvell,xenon-slotno = <0>;
		marvell,xenon-phy-type = "emmc 5.1 phy";
		marvell,xenon-tun-count = <11>;
	};

- For SD/SDIO slot:

	sdhci@ab0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,xenon-sdhci";
		reg = <0xab0000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>
		vqmmc-supply = <&sd_regulator>;
		clocks = <&sdclk>;
		clock-names = "core";
		bus-width = <4>;
		marvell,xenon-tun-count = <9>;
	};
