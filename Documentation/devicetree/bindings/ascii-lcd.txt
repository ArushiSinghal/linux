Binding for simple memory-mapped ASCII LCD displays

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of:
    "img,boston-lcd"
    "mti,malta-lcd"
- reg : memory region locating the device registers

The layout of the registers & properties of the display are determined
from the compatible string, making this binding somewhat trivial.
