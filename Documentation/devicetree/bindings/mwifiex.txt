mwifiex
------

Required properties:

  - name : must be "mwifiex"
  - compatible : must be "marvell,mwifiex"

Optional properties:

  - mwifiex,caldata* : A series of properties with marvell,caldata prefix,
  		      represent Calibration data downloaded to the device during
		      initialization. This is an array of unsigned values.
  - mwifiex,chip-gpio : Chip's wakeup gpio pin number. This needs to be downloaded
			to to firmware. Chip notifies wifi wakeup signal to SOC
			through this pin.

Example:

Tx power limit calibration data is configured in below example.
The calibration data is an array of unsigned values, the length
can vary between hw versions.

mwifiex {
	compatible = "marvell,mwifiex";

	mwifiex,caldata_00_txpwrlimit_2g_cfg_set = /bits/ 8 <
0x01 0x00 0x06 0x00 0x08 0x02 0x89 0x01 ...>;
	mwifiex,chip-gpio = <3>;
};
