TI SRAM Node:
-------------

Many TI SoC's rely on SRAM for running low-level PM code as part of the
suspend or cpuidle path. Because of this, regions in sram must be mapped
as "memory-exec" or "memory-exec-nocache" in order for the region to be
executable.

Optional sub-node
-----------------
Some TI SoCs have secure variants that require a certain portion of
the SRAM to be reserved for use by secure software. This can be
marked in the parent SRAM node with a subnode as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt. This node can be
added in two ways:

- From board dts files for secure platforms to avoid adding it
  for all SoC variants with a fixed size defined.
- As a dummy node in the .dtsi sram node with any size that will be
  modified by a bootloader to the correct size needed.

Sub-node properties:
- compatible : should be "ti,secure-sram"

The rest of the properties should follow the generic mmio-sram discription
found in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.txt

Example:
	/* In parent SoC .dtsi */
	ocmcram: ocmcram@40200000 {
		compatible = "mmio-sram";
		reg = <0x40200000 0x10000>; /* 64k */
		memory-exec-nocache;
		ranges = <0x0 0x40200000 0x10000>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

	};

	/* In board .dts where secure silicon is present */
	&ocmcram {
		sram-hs@0 {
			compatible = "ti,secure-ram";
			reg = <0x0 0xC000>;
		};
	};
