Device-Tree bindings for Synopsys DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller

The controller is a digital core that implements all protocol functions
defined in the MIPI DSI specification, providing an interface between
the system and the MIPI DPHY, and allowing communication with a MIPI DSI
compliant display.

Required properties:
 - #address-cells: Should be <1>.
 - #size-cells: Should be <0>.
 - compatible: The first compatible string should be "fsl,imx6q-mipi-dsi"
   for i.MX6q/sdl SoCs.  For other SoCs, please refer to their specific
   device tree binding documentations.  A common compatible string
   "snps,dw-mipi-dsi" should be appended for all SoCs.
 - reg: Represent the physical address range of the controller.
 - interrupts: Represent the controller's interrupt to the CPU(s).
 - clocks, clock-names: Phandles to the controller's pll reference
   clock(ref), configuration clock(cfg) and APB clock(pclk), as
   described in [1].

For more required properties, please refer to relevant device tree binding
documentations which describe the controller embedded in specific SoCs.

Required sub-nodes:
 - A node to represent a DSI peripheral as described in [2].

For more required sub-nodes, please refer to relevant device tree binding
documentations which describe the controller embedded in specific SoCs.
