Binding for sbs-manager

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sbs,sbs-manager" or "lltc,ltc1760" if device is a
    ltc1760.
- reg: integer, i2c address of the device. Should be <0xa>.

Optional properties:
- sbsm,i2c-retry-count: integer, number of retries for trying to read or write
    to registers. Default: 1

From OS view the device is basically an i2c-mux used to communicate with up to
four smart battery devices at address 0xb. The driver actually implements this
behaviour. So standard i2c-mux nodes can be used to register up to four slave
batteries. Channels will be numerated as 1, 2, 4 and 8.

Example:

batman@0a {
    compatible = "sbs,sbs-manager";
    reg = <0x0a>;
    sbsm,i2c-retry-count = <3>;
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;

    channel1@1 {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        reg = <1>;

        battery1@0b {
            compatible = "sbs-battery";
            reg = <0x0b>;
        };
    };

    channel2@2 {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        reg = <2>;

        battery2@0b {
            compatible = "sbs-battery";
            reg = <0x0b>;
        };
    };

    channel3@4 {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        reg = <4>;

        battery3@0b {
            compatible = "sbs-battery";
            reg = <0x0b>;
        };
    };
};
