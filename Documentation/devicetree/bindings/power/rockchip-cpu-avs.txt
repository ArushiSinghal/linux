Rockchip cpu avs device tree bindings
-------------------------------------

Under the same frequency, the operating voltage tends to decrease with
increasing leakage. so it is necessary to adjust opp's voltage according
to leakage for power.


Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following.
  - "rockchip,rk3399-cpu-avs" - for RK3399 SoCs.
- leakage-volt-<name>: Named leakage-volt property. At runtime, the
  platform can find a cpu's cluster_id according to it's cpu_id and match
  leakage-volt-<name> property. The property is an array of 3-tuples
  items, and each item consists of leakage and voltage like
  <min-leakage-mA max-leakage-mA vol-uV>.
	min-leakage: minimum leakage in mA.
	max-leakage: maximum leakage in mA.
	vol: voltage in microvolt.

Example:

	cpu_avs: cpu-avs {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-cpu-avs";
		leakage-volt-cluster0 = <
		/*  mA        mA         uV*/
		    0         100        0
		    101       200        (-25000)
		    201       300        (-50000)
		>;
		leakage-volt-cluster1 = <
		/*  mA        mA         uV*/
		    0         100        0
		    101       200        (-25000)
		    201       300        (-50000)
		>;
	};
