* Buffalo Linkstation Reset Driver

Power of some Buffalo Linkstation or KuroBox Pro is managed by
micro-controller, which connects to UART1. After being fed from UART1
by a few magic numbers, the so-called power-off command,
the micro-controller will turn power off the device.

This is very similar to QNAP or Synology NAS devices, which is
described in qnap-poweroff.txt, however the command is much simpler,
only 1-byte long and without checksums.

This driver adds a handler to pm_power_off which is called to turn the
power off.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be "linkstation,power-off"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for UART1
- clocks: tclk clock

Example:

	reset {
		compatible = "linkstation,power-off";
		reg = <0x12100 0x100>;
		clocks = <&core_clk 0>;
	};
