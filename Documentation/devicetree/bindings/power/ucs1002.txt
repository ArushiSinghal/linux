UCS1002-2 Programmable USB Port Power Controller with Charger Emulation bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: "microchip,ucs1002"
- reg: integer, the I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: the phandle of the interrupt controller that services
    interrupts for this device.
- interrupts: interrupt specifiers for two interrupt sources.
    - First interrupt specifier is for A_DET interrupt.
    - Second interrupt specifier is for ALERT interrupt.
- microchip,limit-microamps: integer, maximum current in microamps. Note that the
    default value is based on the resistor on the COMM_SEL/ILIM pin and this
    value cannot be changed to be higher than hardware set value. Accepted
    values are: 500000, 900000, 1000000, 1200000, 1500000, 1800000, 2000000 and
    2500000 (microamps).
- control-gpios = list of gpios used as pin states when determining the active mode
    selection and power state. Must provide EM_EN, M1, M2 and PWR_EN gpio mapping.
    If this property is not set it uses I2C for configuration.

Example (polling):

	ucs1002: ucs1002@57 {
		compatible = "microchip,ucs1002";
		reg = <0x57>;
		microchip,limit-microamps = <2000000>;
	};

Example (interrupts + control gpios):

	ucs1002: ucs1002@57 {
		compatible = "microchip,ucs1002";
		reg = <0x57>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
		interrupts = <30 0>, <31 0>;
		control-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,	/* EM_EN */
				<&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,	/* M1 */
				<&gpio1 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,	/* M2 */
				<&gpio1 19 0>;			/* PWR_EN */
	};
