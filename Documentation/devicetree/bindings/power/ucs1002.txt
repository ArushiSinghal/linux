UCS1002-2 Programmable USB Port Power Controller with Charger Emulation bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: "microchip,ucs1002"
- reg: integer, the I2C address of the device.

Required properties (if pin-ignore functionality is not set):
- em-gpios: which GPIO to use for EM_EN pin.
- pwr-gpios: which GPIO to use for PWR_EN pin.
- m1-gpios: which GPIO to use for M1 pin.
- m2-gpios: which GPIO to use for M2 pin.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: the phandle of the interrupt controller that services
    interrupts for this device.
- interrupts: interrupt specifiers for two interrupt sources.
    - First interrupt specifier is for A_DET interrupt.
    - Second interrupt specifier is for ALERT interrupt.
- microchip,current-limit: integer, maximum current in mA. Note that the default
    value is based on the resistor on the COMM_SEL/ILIM pin and this value cannot
    be changed to be higher than hardware set value. Accepted values are: 500000,
    900000, 1000000, 1200000, 1500000, 1800000, 2000000, 2500000 (uA)
- microchip,pin-ignore: boolean, if present uses I2C for configuration, otherwise,
    we must provide EM_EN, M1 and M2 gpio mapping.

Example (poll):

	ucs1002: ucs1002@57 {
		compatible = "microchip,ucs1002";
		reg = <0x57>;
		microchip,current-limit = <2000000>;
		microchip,pin-ignore;
	};

Example (interrupts + pin control):

	ucs1002: ucs1002@57 {
		compatible = "microchip,ucs1002";
		reg = <0x57>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
		interrupts = <30 0>, <31 0>;
		microchip,current-limit = <2000000>;
		em-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		m1-gpios = <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		m2-gpios = <&gpio1 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		pwr-gpios = <&gpio1 19 0>;
	};
