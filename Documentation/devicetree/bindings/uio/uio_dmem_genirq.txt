UIO device for dynamic memory allocation
----------------------------------------

When binding the uio_dmem_genirq via the device tree by setting
the of_id from command line, the following OF properties are
used for initialization:

- uio,number-of-dynamic-regions

  Determines the number of dynamically allocated memory regions
  for the device.

- uio,dynamic-regions-sizes

  Sizes of regions to be allocated. It is expected to contain
  at least uio,number-of-dynamic-regions sizes.
