* Universal Flash Storage (UFS) DesignWare Host Controller

DWC_UFSHC nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list must contain "snps,ufshcd-dwc" and should
		      also contain the JEDEC version of the controller:
			"jedec,ufs-1.1"
			"jedec,ufs-2.0"
- reg               : <registers mapping>
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>

Example:
	ufs@0xd0000000 {
		compatible = "jedec,ufs-2.0", "snps,dwc-ufshcd";
		reg = < 0xd0000000 0x10000 >;
		interrupts = < 24 >;
	};
