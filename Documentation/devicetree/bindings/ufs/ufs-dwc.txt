* Universal Flash Storage (UFS) DesignWare Host Controller

DWC_UFSHC nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains "snps,ufshcd"
- reg               : <registers mapping>
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>

Example:
	dwc_ufshcd@0xD0000000 {
		compatible = "snps,ufshcd";
		reg = < 0xD0000000 0x10000 >;
		interrupts = < 24 >;
	};
