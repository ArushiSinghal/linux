QorIQ SoC USB 2.0 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "fsl,qoriq-usb2-phy",
   Wherever applicable, the version of the USB PHY should
   also be mentioned (for eg. fsl,qoriq-usb2-phy-vX.Y).
   where, X = Phy vendor(Legacy = 1, NXP = 2) and Y = PHY version
 - reg : Address and length of the usb phy control register set.
 - phy_type : For multi port host USB controllers, should be one of
   "ulpi", or "serial". For dual role USB controllers, should be
   one of "ulpi", "utmi", "utmi_wide", or "serial".

The main purpose of this PHY driver is to enable the USB PHY reference clock
gate on the QorIQ SOC for USB2 PHY OR implement errata workaround in
future. Otherwise it is just an NOP PHY driver.

usbphy0: usbphy@8600000 {
        compatible = "fsl,qoriq-usb2-phy" "fsl,qoriq-usb2-phy-vX.Y";
        reg = <0x0 0x8600000 0x0 0x1000>;
        #phy-cells = <0>;
        phy_type = "ulpi";
};
