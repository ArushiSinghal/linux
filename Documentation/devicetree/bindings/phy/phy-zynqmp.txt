Xilinx ZynqMP PHY binding

This binding describes a ZynqMP PHY device that is used to control ZynqMP
High Speed Gigabit Transceiver(GT). ZynqMP PS GTR provides four lanes
and are used by USB, SATA, PCIE, Display port and Ethernet SGMMI controllers.

Required properties (controller (parent) node):
- compatible    : Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-psgtr"

- reg		: Address and length of register sets for each device in
		  "reg-names"
- reg-names     : The names of the register addresses corresponding to the
		  registers filled in "reg":
			- serdes: SERDES block register set
			- siou: SIOU block register set
			- lpd: Low power domain peripherals reset control
			- fpd: Full power domain peripherals reset control

-xlnx,tx_termination_fix: Include fix for a functional issue in the GT. The TX
			  termination resistance can be out of spec due to a
			  bug in the calibration logic. This issue will be fixed
			  in silicon in future versions.

Required nodes	:  A sub-node is required for each lane the controller
		   provides.

Required properties (port (child) nodes):
lane0:
- #phy-cells	: Should be 2
		  Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <PHY_TYPE_PCIE 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SATA 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_USB3 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_DP 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SGMII 0>
lane1:
- #phy-cells	: Should be 2
		  Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <PHY_TYPE_PCIE 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SATA 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_USB3 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_DP 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SGMII 1>
lane2:
- #phy-cells	: Should be 2
		  Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <PHY_TYPE_PCIE 2>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SATA 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_USB3 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_DP 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SGMII 2>
lane3:
- #phy-cells	: Should be 2
		  Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <PHY_TYPE_PCIE 3>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SATA 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_USB3 1>
			- <PHY_TYPE_DP 0>
			- <PHY_TYPE_SGMII 3>

Example:
	zynqmp_phy@fd400000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-psgtr";
		status = "okay";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd400000 0x40000>, <0x0 0xfd3d0000 0x1000>,
			<0x0 0xfd1a0000 0x1000>, <0x0 0xff5e0000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "serdes", "siou", "fpd", "lpd";

		lane0: lane@0 {
			#phy-cells = <2>;
		};
		lane1: lane@1 {
			#phy-cells = <2>;
		};
		lane2: lane@2 {
			#phy-cells = <2>;
		};
		lane3: lane@3 {
			#phy-cells = <2>;
		};
	};

Specifying phy control of devices
=================================

Device nodes should specify the configuration required in their "phys"
property, containing a phandle to the phy port node and a device type.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/phy/phy.h>

	usb@fe200000 {
		...
		phys	  = <&lane2 PHY_TYPE_USB3 0>;
		...
	};

	ahci@fd0c0000 {
		...
		phys	  = <&lane3 PHY_TYPE_SATA 1>;
		...
	};
