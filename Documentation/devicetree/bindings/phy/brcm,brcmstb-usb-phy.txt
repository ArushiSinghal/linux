Required properties:
 - compatible: brcm,brcmstb-usb-phy
 - reg: two offset and length pairs. The second pair specifies the
        USB 3.0 related registers and is only required for PHYs
        that support USB 3.0
 - #phy-cells: Shall be 1 as it expects one argument for setting

usbphy_0: usb-phy@f0470200 {
	reg = <0xf0470200 0xb8>,
		<0xf0471940 0x6c0>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
