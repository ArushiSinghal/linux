ROCKCHIP USB2.0 PHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties (phy (parent) node):
 - compatible : should contain:
	* "rockchip,rk3366-usb2phy"
	* "rockchip,rk3399-usb2phy"
 - #clock-cells : should be 0.
 - clock-names : specify the 480m output clk name.

Optional properties:
 - vbus_host-supply : phandle to a regulator that supplies host vbus.
 - vbus_otg-supply : phandle to a regulator that supplies otg vbus.

Required nodes : a sub-node is required for each port the phy provides.
		 The sub-node name is used to identify host or otg port.

Required properties (port (child) node):
 - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - interrupts : specify an interrupt for each entry in interrupt-names.
 - interrupt-names : a list which shall be the following entries:
	* "otg_id" : for the otg id interrupt.
	* "otg_bvalid" : for the otg vbus interrupt.
	* "linestate" : for the host or otg linestate interrupt.

Example:

grf: syscon@ff770000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3366-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

...

	u2phy: usb2-phy {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3366-usb2phy";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "sclk_otgphy0_480m";

		u2phy_otg: otg-port {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 93 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 95 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "otg_id", "otg_bvalid", "linestate";
			status = "okay";
		};

		u2phy_host: host-port {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 96 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "linestate";
			status = "okay";
		};
	};
};
