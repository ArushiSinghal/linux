Non Volatile RAM device on a Juniper NG PMB FPGA

These devices are found in the PTX series of Juniper routers.

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "jnx,ngpmb-nvram"

Optional properties:
- reg : memory address for the RAM, note that this is not
required since usually the device is a subdevice of the SAM MFD
driver which fills in the register fields.

For the rest of the properties, see mtd-physmap.txt.

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Example:

ngpmb_nvram {
	compatible = "jnx,ngpmb-nvram";
};
