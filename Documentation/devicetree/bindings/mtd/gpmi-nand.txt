* Freescale General-Purpose Media Interface (GPMI)

The GPMI nand controller provides an interface to control the
NAND flash chips.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "fsl,<chip>-gpmi-nand", the chip should be imx23,
    imx28, imx6q, imx6qp, imx6sx, imx6ul or imx7d.
  - reg : should contain registers location and length for gpmi and bch.
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "gpmi-nand" and "bch"
  - interrupts : BCH interrupt number.
  - interrupt-names : Should be "bch".
  - dmas: DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle to DMA controller node
    and GPMI DMA channel ID.
    Refer to dma.txt and fsl-mxs-dma.txt for details.
  - dma-names: Must be "rx-tx".
  - clocks : The clocks needed by the gpmi controller. This field varies
    depends on the SoC design, "gpmi-io" is mandatory but some platforms may
    need several extra clocks, such as i.MX6Q, it requires "gpmi_apb,
    gpmi_bch, gpmi_bch_apb and per1_bch" for all submodules. Please refer to
    the HW design manual.
  - clock-names : the name of the clocks, please refer to the HW design
    manual.

Optional properties:
  - nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option if not
                       present false
  - fsl,use-minimum-ecc: Protect this NAND flash with the minimum ECC
                       strength required. The required ECC strength is
                       automatically discoverable for some flash
                       (e.g., according to the ONFI standard).
                       However, note that if this strength is not
                       discoverable or this property is not enabled,
                       the software may chooses an implementation-defined
                       ECC scheme.
  - fsl,no-blockmark-swap: Don't swap the bad block marker from the OOB
                       area with the byte in the data area but rely on the
                       flash based BBT for identifying bad blocks.
                       NOTE: this is only valid in conjunction with
                             'nand-on-flash-bbt'.
                       WARNING: on i.MX28 blockmark swapping cannot be
                       disabled for the BootROM in the FCB. Thus,
                       partitions written from Linux with this feature
                       turned on may not be accessible by the BootROM
                       code.

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

gpmi-nand@8000c000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-gpmi-nand";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	reg = <0x8000c000 2000>, <0x8000a000 2000>;
	reg-names = "gpmi-nand", "bch";
	interrupts = <41>;
	interrupt-names = "bch";
	dmas = <&dma_apbh 4>;
	dma-names = "rx-tx";
	clocks = <&clks 50>,;
	clock-names = "gpmi_io";

	partition@0 {
	...
	};
};
