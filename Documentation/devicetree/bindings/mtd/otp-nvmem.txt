Representing OTP regions in devicetree

OTP regions can be represented by sub-nodes of an mtd device.

The partition table should be a subnode of the mtd node and should be names
'otp-partitions'. This node should have the following property:

- compatible: (required) must be 'fixed-partitions'

OTP regions are then defined in subnodes of the partitions node.

Required properties for OTP regions:
- reg: The region's offset and size within the mtd device

Optional properties:
- label: The label / name for this region. If ommited, the label is taken
  from the node name (excluding the unit address).

Example:

flash@0 {
	partitions {
		compatible = "fixed-partitions";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		partition@0 {
			label = "uboot-spl";
			reg = <0x0 0xe0000>;
		};
		partition@1 {
			label = "uboot-env";
			reg = <0xe0000 0x20000>;
		};
		partition@2 {
			label = "uboot";
			reg = <0x100000 0x100000>;
		};
	};

	otp-partitions {
		compatible = "fixed-partitions";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		region@0 {
			label = "factory-data";
			reg = <0x0 0x40>;

			#address-cells = <0x1>;
			#size-cells = <0x1>;

			product: nvmem@0 {
				reg = <0x0 0x2>;
			};

			revision: nvmem@3 {
				reg = <0x3 0x2>;
			};
		};
	};
}
