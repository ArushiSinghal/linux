* MTD SPI nor driver for MTK MT81xx (and similar) serial flash controller

Required properties:
- compatible: 	  should be "mediatek,mt8173-nor";
- reg: 		  physical base address and length of the controller's register
- clocks: 	  the phandle of the clock needed by the nor controller
- clock-names: 	  the name of the clocks
		  the clocks needed "spi" and "sf". "spi" is used for spi bus,
		  and "sf" is used for controller, these are the clocks witch
		  hardware needs to enabling nor flash and nor flash controller.
		  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells:	  should be <0>

Example:

nor_flash: spi@1100d000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-nor";
	reg = <0 0x1100d000 0 0xe0>;
	clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_SPI>,
		 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_SPINFI_IFR_SEL>;
	clock-names = "spi", "sf";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	flash@0 {
		....
	};
};
