Ingenic jz47xx GPIO controller

Required properties:
  - compatible:
    - "ingenic,jz4740-gpio" for the JZ4740 SoC
    - "ingenic,jz4780-gpio" for the JZ4780 SoC

  - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the GPIO
    controller hardware module.

  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
    cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the
    GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.
  - gpio-ranges: Range of pins managed by the GPIO controller.

Optional properties:
  - base: The GPIO number to use as the base for this driver.
  - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
    Required if 'interrupt-controller' is specified.

Please refer to gpio.txt in this directory for details of gpio-ranges property
and the common GPIO bindings used by client devices.

The GPIO controller also acts as an interrupt controller. It uses the default
two cells specifier as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

Example:

gpa: gpio-controller@10010000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-gpio";
	reg = <0x10010000 0x100>;

	gpio-controller;
	gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 0 0 32>;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <28>;
};
