Juniper PTXPMB CPLD GPIO block

Required properties:

- compatible:
    Must be "jnx,gpio-ptxpmb-cpld"

- #gpio-cells:
    Should be <2>.  The first cell is the pin number (within the controller's
    pin space), and the second is used for the following flags:
	bit[0]: direction (0 = out, 1 = in)
	bit[1]: init high
	bit[2]: active low

- gpio-controller:
    Specifies that the node is a GPIO controller.

Optional properties:

- reg:
    Address and length of the register set for the device. Usually supplied by
    the parent MFD driver

Example:

gpio_cpld: cpld_gpio {
	compatible = "jnx,gpio-ptxpmb-cpld";
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	gpio-controller;
};
