Raspberry Pi power domain driver

Required properties:

- compatible:		Should be "raspberrypi,firmware-gpio"
- gpio-controller:	Marks the device node as a gpio controller
- #gpio-cells:		Should be <2> for GPIO number and flags
- ngpios:		Number of GPIO lines to control.  See gpio.txt
- firmware:		Reference to the RPi firmware device node
- raspberrypi,firmware-gpio-offset:
			Number the firmware uses for the first GPIO line
			  controlled by this driver

Example:
fxl6408: firmware-gpio-128 {
	compatible = "raspberrypi,firmware-gpio";
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	firmware = <&firmware>;
	ngpios = <8>;
	raspberrypi,firmware-gpio-offset = <128>;
};
