Bindings for the Broadcom's brcm,bcm6345-gpio memory-mapped GPIO controllers.

These bindings should only be used for BCM6338 and BCM6345 SoCs, since newer
ones need a proper pinctrl driver.
BCM6338 have 8-bit data and dirout registers, where GPIO state can be read
and/or written, and the direction changed from input to output.
BCM6345 have 16-bit data and dirout registers, where GPIO state can be read
and/or written, and the direction changed from input to output.

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm6345-gpio"
	- reg-names: must contain
		"dat" - data register
		"dirout" - direction (output) register
	- reg: address + size pairs describing the GPIO register sets;
		order must correspond with the order of entries in reg-names
	- #gpio-cells: must be set to 2. The first cell is the pin number and
			the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
			0 = active high
			1 = active low
	- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

Optional properties:
	- big-endian: Memory is big endian.

Examples:
	- BCM6338:
	gpio0: gpio-controller@fffe0407 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm6345-gpio";
		reg-names = "dirout", "dat";
		reg = <0xfffe0407 1>, <0xfffe040f 1>;

		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
	};

	- BCM6345:
	gpio0: gpio-controller@fffe0406 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm6345-gpio";
		reg-names = "dirout", "dat";
		reg = <0xfffe0406 2>, <0xfffe040a 2>;
		big-endian;

		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
	};
