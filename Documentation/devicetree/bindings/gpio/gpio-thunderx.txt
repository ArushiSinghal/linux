Cavium ThunderX/OCTEON-TX GPIO controller bindings

Required Properties:
- reg: The controller bus address.
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells: Must be 2.
  - First cell is the GPIO pin number relative to the controller.
  - Second cell is standard of_gpio_flags:
     1 - Active Low.
     2 - Single Ended.

Optional Properties:
- compatible: "cavium,thunder-8890-gpio", unused as PCI driver binding is used.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Must be present and have value of 2 if
                    "interrupt-controller" is present.
  - First cell is the GPIO pin number relative to the controller.
  - Second cell is triggering flags, one of:
    1 - Edge Rising
    2 - Edge Falling
    4 - Level High
    8 - Level Low

Example:

gpio_6_0: gpio0@6,0 {
	compatible = "cavium,thunder-8890-gpio";
	reg = <0x3000 0 0 0 0>; /*  DEVFN = 0x30 (6:0) */
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
};
