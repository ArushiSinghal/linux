Bindings for Analog Devices ADG792A/G Triple 4:1 Multiplexers

Required properties:
- compatible : "adi,adg792a" or "adi,adg792g"
- #mux-control-cells : <0> if parallel, or <1> if not.
* Standard mux-controller bindings as decribed in mux-controller.txt

Optional properties:
- adi,parallel : if present, the three muxes are bound together with a single
  mux controller, controlling all three muxes in parallel.
- adi,idle-state : if present, array of states the three mux controllers will
  have when idle (or, if parallel, a single idle-state).

Mux controller states 0 through 3 correspond to signals A through D in the
datasheet. Mux controller states 4 and 5 are only available as possible idle
states. State 4 represents that nothing is connected, and state 5 represents
that the mux controller keeps the mux in its previously selected state during
the idle period. State 5 is the default idle state.

Example:

	/* three independent mux controllers (of which one is used) */
	&i2c0 {
		mux: adg792a@50 {
			compatible = "adi,adg792a";
			reg = <0x50>;
			#mux-control-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

	adc-mux {
		compatible = "iio-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		mux-controls = <&mux 1>;

		channels = "sync-1", "", "out";
	};


	/*
	 * Three parallel muxes with one mux controller, useful e.g. if
	 * the adc is differential, thus needing two signals to be muxed
	 * simultaneously for correct operation.
	 */
	&i2c0 {
		pmux: adg792a@50 {
			compatible = "adi,adg792a";
			reg = <0x50>;
			#mux-control-cells = <0>;
			adi,parallel;
		};
	};

	diff-adc-mux {
		compatible = "iio-mux";
		io-channels = <&adc 0>;
		io-channel-names = "parent";

		mux-controls = <&pmux>;

		channels = "sync-1", "", "out";
	};
