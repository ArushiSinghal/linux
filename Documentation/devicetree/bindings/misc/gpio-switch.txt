Device-Tree bindings for gpio attached switches.

This provides a mechanism to provide a named link to specified gpios. This can
be useful in instances such as when theres a need to monitor a switch, which is
common across a family of devices, but attached to different gpios and even
implemented in different ways on differnet devices.

Required properties:
	- compatible = "gpio-switch";

Each signal is represented as a sub-node of "gpio-switch". The naming of
sub-nodes is arbitrary.

Required sub-node properties:

	- label: Name to be given to gpio switch.
	- gpios: OF device-tree gpio specification.

Optional sub-node properties:

	- read-only: Boolean flag to mark the gpio as read-only, i.e. the line
	  should not be driven by the host.

Example nodes:

        gpio-switch {
                compatible = "gpio-switch";

                write-protect {
                        label = "write-protect";
                        gpios = <&gpx3 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                        read-only;
                };

                developer-switch {
                        label = "developer-switch";
                        gpios = <&gpx1 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                        read-only;
                };

                recovery-switch {
                        label = "recovery-switch";
                        gpios = <&gpx0 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                        read-only;
                };
        };
