* Rockchip rk3399 dmc device

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "rockchip,rk3399-dmc".
- devfreq-events: Node to get ddr loading, Refer to
		  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/devfreq/rockchip-dif.txt
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
	      depends on the interrupt controller. 
- clocks: Phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property
- clock-names : The name of clock used by the DFI, must be "pclk_ddr_mon";
- operating-points-v2: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
		       for details.
- center-supply: Dmc supply node.
- status: Marks the node enabled/disabled.

Optional properties:
- ddr_timing: ddr timing need to pass to arm trust firmware
- upthreshold: the upthreshold to simpleondeamnd policy
- downdifferential: The downdifferential to simpleondeamnd policy

Example:
	dmc: dmc {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-dmc";
		devfreq-events = <&dfi>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_DDRCLK>;
		clock-names = "dmc_clk";
		ddr_timing = <&ddr_timing>;
		operating-points-v2 = <&dmc_opp_table>;
		center-supply = <&ppvar_centerlogic>;
		upthreshold = <15>;
		downdifferential = <10>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
