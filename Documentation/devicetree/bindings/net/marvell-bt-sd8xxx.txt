Marvell 8897/8997 (sd8897/sd8997) bluetooth SDIO devices
------

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be one of the following:
	* "marvell,bt-sd8897"
	* "marvell,bt-sd8997"

Optional properties:

  - btmrvl,cal-data : Calibration data downloaded to the device during
		      initialization. This is an array of 28 values(u8).

  - btmrvl,wakeuppin-gap : wakeup pin and gap (in msecs) combination to be
		      configured to firmware. 'wakeuppin' is a wakeup pin number
		      of bluetooth chip. 'gap' is a wakeup latency of a host platform.
		      This is needed to work chip's sleep feature as expected.
  - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller
  - interrupts : interrupt pin number to the cpu. driver will request an irq based on
  		 this interrupt number. during system suspend, the irq will be enabled
  		 as system wakeup source, so that the bluetooth chip can wakeup host
  		 platform under certain condition. during system resume, the irq will
  		 be disabled to make sure unnecessary interrupt is not received.

Example:

IRQ pin 119 is used as system wakeup source interrupt.
wakeuppin 13 and gap 100ms are configured so that firmware can wakeup host
using this device side pin and wakeup latency.
calibration data is also available in below example.

&mmc3 {
	status = "okay";
	vmmc-supply = <&wlan_en_reg>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	cap-power-off-card;
	keep-power-in-suspend;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	btmrvl: btmrvl@3 {
		compatible = "marvell,bt-sd8897";
		reg = <2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

		btmrvl,cal-data = /bits/ 8 <
			0x37 0x01 0x1c 0x00 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0x01 0x7f 0x04 0x02

		btmrvl,wakeuppin-gap = <0x0d64>;
	};
