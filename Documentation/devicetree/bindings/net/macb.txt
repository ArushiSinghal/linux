* Cadence MACB/GEM Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "cdns,[<chip>-]{macb|gem}"
  Use "cdns,at91sam9260-macb" for Atmel at91sam9 SoCs or the 10/100Mbit IP
  available on sama5d3 SoCs.
  Use "cdns,at32ap7000-macb" for other 10/100 usage or use the generic form: "cdns,macb".
  Use "cdns,pc302-gem" for Picochip picoXcell pc302 and later devices based on
  the Cadence GEM, or the generic form: "cdns,gem".
  Use "atmel,sama5d2-gem" for the GEM IP (10/100) available on Atmel sama5d2 SoCs.
  Use "atmel,sama5d3-gem" for the Gigabit IP available on Atmel sama5d3 SoCs.
  Use "atmel,sama5d4-gem" for the GEM IP (10/100) available on Atmel sama5d4 SoCs.
  Use "cdns,zynqmp-gem" for Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain macb interrupt
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- clock-names: Tuple listing input clock names.
	Required elements: 'pclk', 'hclk'
	Optional elements: 'tx_clk'
- clocks: Phandles to input clocks.

Optional properties:
- cdns,usrio-has-clken: Boolean; The USRIO register has an clock-enable bit.
- cdns,usrio-default-mii: Boolean; The USRIO register defaults to MII mode.
- cdns,usrio-disabled: Boolean; The USRIO register is not implemented.
- cdns,no-gigabit-half: Boolean; The MAC does not support 1000/Half link mode.
- cdns,gem-sg-disabled: Boolean; The MAC does not support Scatter-Gather mode.
- cdns,gem-has-gigabit: Boolean; The MAC supports Gigabit Ethernet.
- cdns,dma-burst-length: Should countain the DMA burst length.
- cdns,jumbo-max-length: Should countain the maximum Jumbo frame length.

Examples:

	macb0: ethernet@fffc4000 {
		compatible = "cdns,at32ap7000-macb";
		reg = <0xfffc4000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <21>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		local-mac-address = [3a 0e 03 04 05 06];
		clock-names = "pclk", "hclk", "tx_clk";
		clocks = <&clkc 30>, <&clkc 30>, <&clkc 13>;
	};
