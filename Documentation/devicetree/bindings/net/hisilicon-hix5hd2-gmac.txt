Hisilicon hix5hd2 gmac controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain one of the following version strings:
	* "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v1"
	* "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v2"
	and one of the following SoC string:
	* "hisilicon,hix5hd2-gemac"
	* "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-gemac"
- reg: specifies base physical address(s) and size of the device registers.
  The first region is the MAC register base and size.
  The second region is external interface control register.
- interrupts: should contain the MAC interrupt.
- #address-cells: must be <1>.
- #size-cells: must be <0>.
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt [1].
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt [1].
- mac-address: see ethernet.txt [1].
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair.
- clock-names: contain the clock name "mac_core" and "mac_ifc".
- resets: should contain the phandle to the MAC core reset signal(required),
	the MAC interface reset signal(required)
	and the PHY reset signal(optional).
- reset-names: contain the reset signal name "mac_core"(required),
	"mac_ifc"(required) and "phy"(optional).
- hisilicon,phy-reset-delays-us: triplet of delays if PHY reset signal given.
	The 1st cell is reset pre-delay in micro seconds.
	The 2nd cell is reset pulse in micro seconds.
	The 3rd cell is reset post-delay in micro seconds.

- PHY subnode: inherits from phy binding [2]
