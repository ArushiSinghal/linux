* Aurora VLSI AU-NB8800 Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sigma,smp8640-ethernet", "aurora,nb8800"
	The former indicates presence of extra features added by Sigma Designs.
- reg: Should be MMIO address space of the device
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt specifier for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be a phandle for the interrupt controller
- clocks: Should be a phandle for the clock for the device

Common properties described in ethernet.txt:
- local-mac-address
- mac-address
- max-speed
- phy-mode

Example:

ethernet@26000 {
	compatible = "aurora,nb8800";
	reg = <0x10000 0x800>;
	interrupts = <42>;
	clocks = <&sys_clk>;
	max-speed = <1000>;
	phy-connection-type = "rgmii";
};
