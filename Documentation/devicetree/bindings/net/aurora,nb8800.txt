* Aurora VLSI AU-NB8800 Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sigma,<chip>-ethernet", "aurora,nb8800"
- reg: Should be MMIO address space of the device
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt specifier for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be a phandle for the interrupt controller
- clocks: Should be a phandle for the clock for the device
- #address-cells: Should be <1>
- #size-cells: Should be <0>

Common properties described in ethernet.txt:
- local-mac-address
- mac-address
- phy-handle
- phy-mode

The attached PHY should be specified in a child node as per phy.txt.

Example:

ethernet@26000 {
	compatible = "sigma,smp8642-ethernet", "aurora,nb8800";
	reg = <0x26000 0x800>;
	interrupts = <38>;
	clocks = <&sys_clk>;
	max-speed = <1000>;
	phy-connection-type = "rgmii";
	phy-handle = <&eth0_phy>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	eth0_phy: ethernet-phy@1 {
		compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
		reg = <1>;
	};
};
