Qualcomm EMAC Gigabit Ethernet Controller

Required properties:
- cell-index : EMAC controller instance number.
- compatible : Should be "qcom,emac".
- reg : Offset and length of the register regions for the device
- reg-names : Register region names referenced in 'reg' above.
	Required register resource entries are:
	"base"   : EMAC controller base register block.
	"csr"    : EMAC wrapper register block.
	Optional register resource entries are:
	"ptp"    : EMAC PTP (1588) register block.
		   Required if 'qcom,emac-tstamp-en' is present.
	"sgmii"  : EMAC SGMII PHY register block.
- interrupts : Interrupt numbers used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Interrupt resource names referenced in 'interrupts' above.
	Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"emac_core0"   : EMAC core0 interrupt.
	"sgmii_irq"   : EMAC SGMII interrupt.
- qcom,emac-gpio-mdc  : GPIO pin number of the MDC line of MDIO bus.
- qcom,emac-gpio-mdio : GPIO pin number of the MDIO line of MDIO bus.
- phy-addr            : Specifies phy address on MDIO bus.
			Required if the optional property "qcom,no-external-phy"
			is not specified.

Optional properties:
- qcom,emac-tstamp-en       : Enables the PTP (1588) timestamping feature.
			      Include this only if PTP (1588) timestamping
			      feature is needed. If included, "ptp" register
			      base should be specified.
- mac-address               : The 6-byte MAC address. If present, it is the
			      default MAC address.
- qcom,no-external-phy      : Indicates there is no external PHY connected to
			      EMAC. Include this only if the EMAC is directly
			      connected to the peer end without EPHY.
- qcom,emac-ptp-grandmaster : Enable the PTP (1588) grandmaster mode.
			      Include this only if PTP (1588) is configured as
			      grandmaster.
- qcom,emac-ptp-frac-ns-adj : The vector table to adjust the fractional ns per
			      RTC clock cycle.
			      Include this only if there is accuracy loss of
			      fractional ns per RTC clock cycle. For individual
			      table entry, the first field indicates the RTC
			      reference clock rate. The second field indicates
			      the number of adjustment in 2 ^ -26 ns.
