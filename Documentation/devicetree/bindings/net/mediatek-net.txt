iMEdiatek Frame Engine Ethernet controller
=======================================

The frame engine ethernet controller can be found on Ralink and Mediatek SoCs
(RT288x, RT3x5x, RT366x, RT388x, rt5350, mt7620, mt7621, mt76x8).

Depending on the SoC, there is a number of ports connected to the CPU port
directly and/or via a (gigabit-)switch. Newer gigabit SoCs can support
a dual MAC setup.

* Ethernet controller node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of "ralink,rt2880-eth", "ralink,rt3050-eth",
  "ralink,rt3050-eth", "ralink,rt3883-eth", "ralink,rt5350-eth",
  "mediatek,mt7620-eth", "mediatek,mt7621-eth", "mediatek,mt7623-eth"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the frame engines interrupt
- mediatek,ethsys: phandle to the syscon node that handles the port setup

Required properties for ARM based SoCs:
- clocks: the clock used by the core
- clock-names: the names of the clock listed in the clocks property
- power-domains: phandle the to power domain that the ethernet is part of

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- mediatek,switch : phandle pointing at the device node of the switch device


* Ethernet port node for MT7620

We need to define which physical port is wired and how it should be setup.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,eth-port"
- reg: The number of the physical port
- phy-handle: reference to the node describing the phy


* Ethernet MAC node - dual MAC SoCs only

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,eth-mac"
- reg: The number of the MAC


Example for singel MAC SoC:

mdio-bus {
	status = "okay";

	phy4: ethernet-phy@4 {
		reg = <4>;
		phy-mode = "rgmii";
	};
};

eth: ethernet@10100000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7620-eth";
	reg = <0x10100000 10000>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
	interrupts = <5>;

	mediatek,switch = <&gsw>;

	port@4 {
		status = "okay";
		phy-mode = "rgmii";
		phy-handle = <&phy4>;
	};
};


Example for dual MAC SoC:

eth: ethernet@1b100000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-eth";
	reg = <0 0x1b100000 0 0x10000>;

	clocks = <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHIF_SEL>;
	clock-names = "ethif";

	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 200 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	power-domains = <&scpsys MT2701_POWER_DOMAIN_ETH>;

	mediatek,ethsys = <&ethsys>;
	mediatek,switch = <&gsw>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	status = "disabled";

	gmac1: mac@0 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <0>;

		status = "okay";
	};

	gmac2: mac@1 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <1>;

		status = "okay";
	};
};
