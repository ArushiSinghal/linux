* Synopsys DWC Ethernet QoS IP version 4.10 driver (GMAC)

This binding supports the Synopsys Designware Ethernet QoS (Quality Of Service)
IP block. The IP supports multiple options for bus type, clocking and reset
structure, and feature list. Consequently, a number of properties and list
entries in properties are marked as optional, or only required in specific HW
configurations.

Required properties:
- compatible: One of:
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    Represents the IP core when integrated into the Axis ARTPEC-6 SoC.
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    Represents the IP core when integrated into the NVIDIA Tegra186 SoC.
  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    This combination is deprecated. It should be treated as equivalent to
    "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10". It is supported to be
    compatible with earlier revisions of this binding.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifiers for each entry in clock-names, in the
  same order. See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
  configuration, in any order:
  - "tx"
    (Alternate name "phy_ref_clk"; only one alternate must appear.)
    The EQOS transmit path clock. The HW signal name is clk_tx_i.
    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock also drives the PHY TX
    path. In other configurations, other clocks (such as tx_125, rmii) may
    drive the PHY TX path.
  - "rx"
    The EQOS receive path clock. The HW signal name is clk_rx_i.
    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock also drives the PHY RX
    path. In other configurations, other clocks (such as rx_125, pmarx_0,
    pmarx_1, rmii) may drive the PHY RX path.
  - "slave_bus"
    (Alternate name "apb_pclk"; only one alternate must appear.)
    The CPU/slave-bus (CSR) interface clock. Despite the name, this applies to
    any bus type; APB, AHB, AXI, etc. The HW signal name is hclk_i (AHB) or
    clk_csr_i (other buses).
  - "master_bus"
    The master bus interface clock. Only required in configurations that use a
    separate clock for the master and slave bus interfaces. The HW signal name
    is hclk_i (AHB) or aclk_i (AXI).
  - "ptp_ref"
    The PTP reference clock. The HW signal name is clk_ptp_ref_i.

  Note: Support for additional IP configurations may require adding the
  following clocks to this list in the future: clk_rx_125_i, clk_tx_125_i,
  clk_pmarx_0_i, clk_pmarx1_i, clk_rmii_i, clk_revmii_rx_i, clk_revmii_tx_i.

  The following compatible values require the following set of clocks:
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "slave_bus"
    - "master_bus"
    - "rx"
    - "tx"
    - "ptp_ref"
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "phy_ref_clk"
    - "apb_clk"
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the core's combined interrupt signal
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- resets: Phandle and reset specifiers for each entry in reset-names, in the
  same order. See ../reset/reset.txt.
- reset-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
  configuration, in any order:
  - "eqos". The reset to the entire module. The HW signal name is hreset_n
    (AHB) or aresetn_i (AXI).

  The following compatible values require the following set of resets:
  (the reset properties may be omitted if empty)
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "eqos".
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - None.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent
- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- phy-reset-gpios: Phandle and specifier for any GPIO used to reset the PHY.
  See ../gpio/gpio.txt.
- snps,en-lpi: If present it enables use of the AXI low-power interface
- snps,write-requests: Number of write requests that the AXI port can issue.
  It depends on the SoC configuration.
- snps,read-requests: Number of read requests that the AXI port can issue.
  It depends on the SoC configuration.
- snps,burst-map: Bitmap of allowed AXI burst lengts, with the LSB
  representing 4, then 8 etc.
- snps,txpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the TX DMA
- snps,rxpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the RX DMA
- snps,en-tx-lpi-clockgating: Enable gating of the MAC TX clock during
  TX low-power mode.
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- mdio device tree subnode: When the GMAC has a phy connected to its local
    mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
    required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-mdio".
    - #address-cells: Must be <1>.
    - #size-cells: Must be <0>.

    For each phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
    fields:

    - reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
    - device_type: Must be "ethernet-phy".
    - fixed-mode device tree subnode: see fixed-link.txt in the same directory
