Common IEEE 802.11 properties

This provides documentation of common properties that are handled by a proper
net layer and don't require extra driver code.

Optional properties:
 - ieee80211-min-center-freq : minimal supported frequency in KHz
 - ieee80211-max-center-freq : maximal supported frequency in KHz

Example:

pcie@0,0 {
	reg = <0x0000 0 0 0 0>;
	ieee80211-min-center-freq = <2437000>;
	ieee80211-max-center-freq = <2457000>;
};
