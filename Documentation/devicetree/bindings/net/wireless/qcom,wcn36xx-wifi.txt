Qualcomm WCN36xx WiFi Binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm WCN36xx WiFi hardware. The hardware block
is part of the Qualcomm WCNSS core, a WiFi/BT/FM combo chip, found in a variety
of Qualcomm platforms.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,wcn3620-wlan",
		    "qcom,wcn3660-wlan",
		    "qcom,wcn3680-wlan"

- qcom,smd-channel:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: standard SMD property specifying the SMD channel used for
		    communication with the WiFi firmware

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should specify the two IRQs for tx and rx respectively

- qcom,wcnss-mmio:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoed-array>
	Definition: should specify base address and size of the WiFi related
		    registers of WCNSS

- qcom,state:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should specify the tx-enable and tx-ring-empty state
		    references

- qcom,state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: name of the states, must be "tx-enable", "tx-rings-empty";

- local-mac-address:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array> encoded as array of hex numbers
	Definition: specifies MAC address that was assigned to the network
		    device described by the node containing this property.

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a SMD node, with one edge representing the
"pronto" subsystem, with the wcn3680 WiFi device described; as found on the
8974 platform.

smd {
	compatible = "qcom,smd";

	pronto {
		interrupts = <0 142 1>;

		qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 17>;
		qcom,smd-edge = <6>;

		wifi {
			compatible = "qcom,wcn3680-wlan";
			qcom,smd-channels = "WLAN_CTRL";

			interrupts = <0 145 0>, <0 146 0>;
			interrupt-names = "tx", "rx";

			qcom,wcnss-mmio = <0xfb000000 0x21b000>;

			qcom,state = <&apps_smsm 10>, <&apps_smsm 9>;
			qcom,state-names = "tx-enable", "tx-rings-empty";
		};
	};
};
