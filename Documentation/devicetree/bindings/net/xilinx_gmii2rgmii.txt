* XILINX GMIITORGMII Converter Driver

The Gigabit Media Independent Interface (GMII) to Reduced Gigabit Media
Independent Interface (RGMII) core provides the RGMII between RGMII-compliant
Ethernet physical media devices (PHY) and the Gigabit Ethernet controller.
This core can be used in all three modes of operation(10/100/1000 Mb/s).
The Management Data Input/Output (MDIO) interface is used to configure the
Speed of operation. This core can switch dynamically between the three
Different speed modes by configuring the conveter register through mdio write.

The MDIO is a bus to which the PHY devices are connected.  For each
device that exists on this bus, a child node should be created.  See
the definition of the PHY node in booting-without-of.txt for an example
of how to define a PHY.

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "xlnx,gmiitorgmii"
  - reg : The ID number for the phy, usually a small integer

Example:
	mdio {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
		ethernet-phy@0 {
			......
		};
                gmii_to_rgmii: gmii_to_rgmii@8 {
                        compatible = "xlnx,gmiitorgmii";
                        reg = <8>;
                };
        };
