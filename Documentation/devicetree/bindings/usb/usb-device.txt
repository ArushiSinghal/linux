Generic USB Device Properties

Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
The reference binding doc is from:
http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps

Required properties:
- compatible: usbVID,PID
- reg: the port number which this device is connecting to.


Example:

hub: genesys@01 {
	compatible = "usb05e3,0608";
	reg = <0x01>;
};
