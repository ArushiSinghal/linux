Samsung S3C2410 and compatible SoC USB controller

OHCI

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "samsung,s3c2410-ohci" for USB host controller
 - reg: address and lenght of the controller memory mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt number for the USB OHCI controller
 - clocks: Should reference the bus and host clocks
 - clock-names: Should contain two strings
		"usb-bus-host" for the USB bus clock
		"usb-host" for the USB host clock

Example:

usb0: ohci@49000000 {
	compatible = "samsung,s3c2410-ohci";
	reg = <0x49000000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0 0 26 3>;
	clocks = <&clocks UCLK>, <&clocks HCLK_USBH>;
	clock-names = "usb-bus-host", "usb-host";
};

Samsung S3C2410 and compatible USB device controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	       "samsung,s3c2410-udc"
	       "samsung,s3c2440-udc"
 - reg: address and length of the controller memory mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt number for the USB device controller
 - clocks: Should reference the bus and host clocks
 - clock-names: Should contain two strings
		"uclk" for the USB bus clock
		"usb-device" for the USB device clock

Optional properties:
 - samsung,vbus-gpio: specifies a gpio that allows to detect whether
   vbus is present - USB is connected (active high, input).
 - samsung,pullup-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio to control the
   USB D+ pullup (active high, output).

usb1: udc@52000000 {
	compatible = "samsung,s3c2440-udc";
	reg = <0x52000000 0x100000>;
	interrupts = <0 0 25 3>;
	clocks = <&clocks UCLK>, <&clocks HCLK_USBD>;
	clock-names = "usb-bus-gadget", "usb-device";
	samsung,pullup-gpio = <&gpc 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};
