Synopsys USB Device controller.

The device node is used for Synopsys Designware Cores AHB
Subsystem Device Controller (UDC).

This device node is used by UDCs integrated it Broadcom's
Northstar2 and Cygnus SoC's.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "snps,dw-ahb-udc"
 - reg: Offset and length of UDC register set
 - interrupts: description of interrupt line
 - phys: phandle to phy node.
 - extcon: phandle to the extcon device. This is optional and
   not required for those that don't require extcon support.
   Extcon support will be required if the UDC is connected to
   a Dual Role Device Phy that supports both Host and Device
   mode based on the external cable.

Example:
	udc_dwc: usb@664e0000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-ahb-udc";
		reg = <0x664e0000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 424 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usbdrd_phy>;
		extcon = <&usbdrd_phy>";
	};
