Generic Onboard USB HUB

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "generic-onboard-hub"

Optional properties:
- clocks: the input clock for HUB.

- clock-names: Should be "external_clk"

- hub-reset-gpios: Should specify the GPIO for reset.

- hub-reset-active-high: the active reset signal is high, if this property is
  not set, the active reset signal is low.

- hub-reset-duration-us: the duration for assert reset signal, the time unit
  is microsecond.

Example:

	usb_hub1 {
		compatible = "generic-onboard-hub";
		clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_CKO>;
		clock-names = "external_clk";
		hub-reset-gpios = <&gpio7 12 0>;
		hub-reset-active-high;
		hub-reset-duration-us = <2>;
	};
