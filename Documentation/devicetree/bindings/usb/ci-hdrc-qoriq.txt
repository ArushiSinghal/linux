* Freescale QorIQ SoC USB 2.0 Controllers

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,ci-qoriq-usb2"
  Wherever applicable, the IP version of the USB controller should
  also be mentioned (for eg. fsl,ci-qoriq-usb2-vX.Y).
  where, X.Y is IP version of USB controller.
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain controller interrupt
- phy-names: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
- phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
- clocks: clock provider specifier
- clock-names: shall be "usb2-clock"
Refer to clk/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties

Recommended properties:
- dr_mode: One of "host" or "peripheral".
- phy_type: the type of the phy connected to the core. Should be one
  of "utmi", "utmi_wide", "ulpi", "serial" or "hsic". Without this
  property the PORTSC register won't be touched

Examples:
usb@8600000 {
	compatible =  "fsl,ci-qoriq-usb2",
		      "fsl,ci-qoriq-usb2-v2.5";
	reg = <0x0 0x8600000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 139 0x4>;
	phy-names = "usb2-phy";
	phys = <&usbphy0>;
	clock-names = "usb2-clock";
	clocks = <&clockgen 4 3>;
	dr_mode = "host";
	phy_type = "ulpi";
};
