Platform DesignWare HS OTG USB 2.0 controller
-----------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : One of:
  - brcm,bcm2835-usb: The DWC2 USB controller instance in the BCM2835 SoC.
  - hisilicon,hi6220-usb: The DWC2 USB controller instance in the hi6220 SoC.
  - rockchip,rk3066-usb: The DWC2 USB controller instance in the rk3066 Soc;
  - "rockchip,rk3188-usb", "rockchip,rk3066-usb", "snps,dwc2": for rk3188 Soc;
  - "rockchip,rk3288-usb", "rockchip,rk3066-usb", "snps,dwc2": for rk3288 Soc;
  - "lantiq,arx100-usb": The DWC2 USB controller instance in Lantiq ARX SoCs;
  - "lantiq,xrx200-usb": The DWC2 USB controller instance in Lantiq XRX SoCs;
  - "amlogic,meson8b-usb": The DWC2 USB controller instance in Amlogic Meson8b SoCs;
  - "amlogic,meson-gxbb-usb": The DWC2 USB controller instance in Amlogic S905 SoCs;
  - "amcc,dwc-otg": The DWC2 USB controller instance in AMCC Canyonlands 460EX SoCs;
  - snps,dwc2: A generic DWC2 USB controller with default parameters.
- reg : Should contain 1 register range (address and length)
- interrupts : Should contain 1 interrupt

Optional properties:
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Contain the following optional clocks on demand:
  - "otg":	AHB clock. It is the scan clock for the core's AHB domain.
  - "pmu":	PMU hclk. Clock to PMU module when hibernation and/or ADP is enabled.
  - "utmi":	UTMI+ clock. Functionally used only when a UTMI PHY is selected,
		but always used as the PHY domain clock during DFT Scan mode.
  - "ulpi":	ULPI PHY clock. Present only when a ULPI PHY is selected; negedge
		is also used in DDR mode.
  - "utmifs":	UTMI FS clock. Present only when OTG_FSPHY_INTERFACE != 0.
Refer to clk/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties
- phys: phy provider specifier
- phy-names: shall be "usb2-phy"
Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for generic phy consumer properties
- dr_mode: shall be one of "host", "peripheral" and "otg"
  Refer to usb/generic.txt
- g-rx-fifo-size: size of rx fifo size in gadget mode.
- g-np-tx-fifo-size: size of non-periodic tx fifo size in gadget mode.
- g-tx-fifo-size: size of periodic tx fifo per endpoint (except ep0) in gadget mode.

Deprecated properties:
- g-use-dma: gadget DMA mode is automatically detected

Example:

        usb@101c0000 {
                compatible = "ralink,rt3050-usb, snps,dwc2";
                reg = <0x101c0000 40000>;
                interrupts = <18>;
		clocks = <&usb_otg_ahb_clk>;
		clock-names = "otg";
		phys = <&usbphy>;
		phy-names = "usb2-phy";
        };
