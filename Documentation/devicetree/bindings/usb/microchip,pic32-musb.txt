Microchip PIC32 MUSB DRC/OTG controller
-------------------------------------------

Required properties:
 - compatible       : should be "microchip,pic32mzda-usb".
 - reg              : offset and length of "MUSB Core Registers" and
                      "USB Clock & Reset Registers".
 - reg-names        : should be "mc", and "usbcr" in order
 - clocks           : clock specifier for the musb controller clock
 - clock-names      : should be "usb_clk"
 - interrupts       : interrupt number for MUSB Core General interrupt
                      and DMA interrupt
 - interrupt-names  : must be "mc" and "dma" in order.
 - phys             : phy specifier for the otg phy.
 - dr_mode          : should be one of "host", "peripheral" or "otg".
 - mentor,multipoint: Should be "1" indicating the musb controller supports
                      multipoint. This is MUSB configuration-specific setting.
 - mentor,num-eps   : Specifies the number of endpoints. This is also a
                      MUSB configuration-specific setting. Should be set to "8".
 - mentor,ram-bits  : Specifies the ram address size. Should be set to "11".
 - mentor,power     : Should be "500". This signifies the controller can supply
                      up to 500mA when operating in host mode.
 - phys             : phandle of the USB phy.
 - usb_overcurrent  : phandle to MUSB over-current note. It should have
                      interrupt number for over-current detection logic.

Optional properties:
 - microchip,fifo-mode: Specifies layout of internal SRAM for end-point fifos.
                        Should be 0 (default) or 1.

		reg-names = "mc", "usbcr";
		interrupts = <132 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			     <133 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "mc", "dma";
		dr_mode = "host";

	};

	usb1_overcurrent: hsusb1_oc@0 {
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	};
