Rockchip Electronics And Security Accelerator

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "rockchip,rk3288-crypto"
- reg: base physical address of the engine and length of memory mapped
       region
- interrupts: interrupt number
- clocks: reference to the clocks about crypto
- clock-names: "aclk" used to clock data
	       "hclk" used to clock data
	       "srst" used to clock crypto accelerator
	       "apb_pclk" used to clock dma

Examples:

	crypto: cypto-controller@ff8a0000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-crypto";
		reg = <0xff8a0000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_CRYPTO>,
			 <&cru HCLK_CRYPTO>,
			 <&cru SCLK_CRYPTO>,
			 <&cru ACLK_DMAC1>;
		clock-names = "aclk",
			      "hclk",
			      "sclk",
			      "apb_pclk";
		status = "okay";
	};
