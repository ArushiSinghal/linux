Intel FPGA Video and Image Processing(VIP) Frame Buffer bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: "intel,vip-frame-buffer2"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the framebuffer controller's
  registers.
- max-width: The width of the framebuffer in pixels.
- max-height: The height of the framebuffer in pixels.
- bits-per-color: only "8" is currently supported
- mem-word-width = the bus width of the avalon master port on the frame reader

Example:

alt_vip_vfr_0: vip@0xff260000 {
	compatible = "intel,vip-frame-buffer2";
	reg = <0xff260000 0x00000080>;
	max-width = <1024>;
	max-height = <768>;
	bits-per-color = <8>;
	mem-word-width = <128>;
};
