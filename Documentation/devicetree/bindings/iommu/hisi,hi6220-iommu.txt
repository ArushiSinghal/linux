Hi6220 SoC SMMU Device Driver devicetree document
The media system shared the same smmu IP to access DDR memory. And all
media IP used the same page table.

Below binding describes the system mmu for media system in hi6220 platform

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "hisilicon,hi6220-smmu".
- reg: A tuple of base address and size of System MMU registers.
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain:
  * "smmu"
  * "media-sc"
  * "smmu-peri"
- interrupts: An interrupt specifier for interrupt signal of System MMU.
- #iommu-cells: The iommu-cells should be 0. Because no additional information
  needs to be encoded in the specifier.

Examples:
	iommu@f4210000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-smmu";
		reg = <0x0 0xf4210000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 113 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&sys_ctrl HI6220_MMU_CLK>,
		         <&media_ctrl HI6220_MED_MMU>,
		         <&sys_ctrl HI6220_MEDIA_PLL_SRC>;
		clock-names = "smmu",
			      "media-sc",
			      "smmu-peri";
		#iommu-cells = <0>;
	};
