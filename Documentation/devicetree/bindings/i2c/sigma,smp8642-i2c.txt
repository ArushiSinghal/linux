Sigma Designs SMP8642 I2C master

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "sigma,smp8642-i2c"
- reg: physical address space of the device
- interrupts: the interrupt of the device
- clocks: phandle of the clock for the device
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells: should be <0>

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency: frequency of bus clock in Hz, default 100kHz

Example:

i2c@10480 {
	compatible = "sigma,smp8642-i2c";
	reg = <0x10480 0x2c>;
	interrupts = <22 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&sys_clk>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
