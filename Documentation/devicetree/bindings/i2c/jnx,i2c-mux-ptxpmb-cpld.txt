* Juniper PTXPMB CPLD I2C Mux

I2C mux on the PTXPMB CPLD on Juniper series of routers.

Required properties:

  - compatible: Must contain one of the following.
    "jnx,i2c-mux-ptxpmb-cpld", "jnx,i2c-mux-ngpmb-bcpld"
  - num-enable: Number of muxes to enable.

  The following required properties are defined externally:

  - Standard I2C mux properties. See i2c-mux.txt in this directory.
  - I2C child bus nodes. See i2c-mux.txt in this directory.

Optional Properties:

  - num-channels: Number of channels. If not present the default is 8.
  - base-bus-num: Base bus number. If not present it is 0.
  - use-force: Use the force method of the controller.


Example:

cpld-i2c-mux {
	compatible = "jnx,i2c-mux-ptxpmb-cpld";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	i2c-parent = <&i2c1>;

	num-enable = <1>;

	i2c@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		/* PMB devices are accessed through FPC */

		temp-sensor@1a { /* FPC */
			compatible = "maxim,max6697";
			reg = <0x1a>;
			smbus-timeout-disable;
			resistance-cancellation;
			alert-mask = <0xff>;
			over-temperature-mask = <0xff>;
		};
	};
};
