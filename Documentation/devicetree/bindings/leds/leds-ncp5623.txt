* ON Semiconductor - NCP5623 3-Channel LED Driver

The NCP5623 is a 3-channel I2C LED driver. The brightness of each
channel can be independently set using 32 levels. Each LED is represented
as a sub-node of the device.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "onnn,ncp5623"
  - reg: I2C slave address (fixed to 0x38)
  - #address-cells: must be 1
  - #size-cells: must be 0
  - onnn,led-iref-microamp: Current on the Iref pin in microampere
  - led-max-microamp: Desired maximum current for each LED in microampere
                      (maximum 30000uA)

LED sub-node properties:
  - reg : LED channel number (0..2)
  - For other LED properties see:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

led1: ncp5623@38 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "onnn,ncp5623";
	reg = <0x38>;

	led1_r@0 {
		label = "ncp:power:red";
		reg = <0>;
		linux,default-trigger = "default-on";
	};

	led1_b@1 {
		label = "ncp:power:blue";
		reg = <1>;
	};

	led1_g@2 {
		label = "ncp:power:green";
		reg = <2>;
	};
};
