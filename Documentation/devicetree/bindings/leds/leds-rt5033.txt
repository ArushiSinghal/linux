* Richtek Technology Corporation - RT5033 Flash LED Driver

The RT5033 Flash LED Circuit is designed for one or two LEDs driving
for torch and strobe applications, it provides an I2C software command
to trigger the torch and strobe operation.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "richtek,rt5033-led".

A discrete LED element connected to the device must be represented by a child
node - see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt.

Required properties of the LED child node:
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- led-max-microamp : Minimum Threshold for Timer protection
  is defined internally (Maximum 200mA).
- flash-max-microamp : Flash LED maximum current
- flash-max-timeout-us : Flash LED maximum timeout

Optional properties of the LED child node:
- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

rt5033 {
	compatible = "richtek,rt5033";

	led {
		compatible = "richtek,rt5033-led";

		flash-led {
			label = "rt5033-flash";
			led-max-microamp = <200000>;
			flash-max-microamp = <800000>;
			flash-max-timeout-us = <1216000>;
		};
	};
}
