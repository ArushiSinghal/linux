Device Tree Bindings for LED support on MT6323 PMIC

MT6323 LED controller is subfunction provided by
MT6323 PMIC, so the LED controller are defined as
the subnode of the function node provided by MT6323
PMIC controller that is being defined as one kind of
Muti-Function Device (MFD) using shared bus called
PMIC wrapper for each subfunction to access remote
MT6323 PMIC hardware.

For MT6323 MFD bindings see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt
For MediaTek PMIC wrapper bindings see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/mediatek/pwrap.txt

There's sub-node for the LED controller that describes
the initial behavior for each LED physcially and currently
only four LED sub-nodes could be supported.

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "mediatek,mt6323-led"

Optional properties:
- label : (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-trigger : (optional)
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- default-state: (optional) The initial state of the LED
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

&pwrap {
	pmic: mt6323 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6323";
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <150 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

		mt6323led: mt6323led{
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-led";

			led0: isink0 {
				lebel = "LED0"
				linux,default-trigger = "timer";
				default-state = "on";
			};
			led1: isink1 {
				label = "LED1";
				default-state = "on";
			};
			led2: isink2 {
				label = "LED2";
				linux,default-trigger = "timer";
				default-state = "off";
			};
		};
	};
};
