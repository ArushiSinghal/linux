* AHCI SATA Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
The AMD Seattle SATA controller mostly conforms to the AHCI interface
with some special SGPIO register to contro activity LED interfaces.

In the case of an AHCI controller, the SGPIO feature is ideally implemented
using the "Enclosure Management" register of the AHCI controller, but
those registeres are not implemented in the Seattle SoC.

Each SATA controller should have its own node.


Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible string should be "amd,seattle-ahci".
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent      : Present if dma operations are coherent
- clocks            : a list of phandle + clock specifier pairs
- target-supply     : regulator for SATA target power
- phys              : reference to the SATA PHY node
- phy-names         : must be "sata-phy"

Examples:
        sata0@e0300000 {
		compatible = "amd,seattle-ahci";
		reg = <0x0 0xe0300000 0x0 0xf0000>, <0x0 0xe0000078 0x0 0x1>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x163 0x4>;
		clocks = <0x2>
		dma-coherent;
        };
