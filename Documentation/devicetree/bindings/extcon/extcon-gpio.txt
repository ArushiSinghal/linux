GPIO Extcon device

This is a virtual device used to generate the specific cable states from the
GPIO pin.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "extcon-gpio".
- extcon-id: The extcon support the various type of external connector to check
  whether connector is attached or detached. The each external connector has
  the unique number to identify it. So this property includes the unique number
  which indicates the specific external connector. When external connector is
  attached or detached, GPIO pin detect the changed state. See include/
  dt-bindings/extcon/extcon.h which defines the unique number for supported
  external connector from extcon framework.
- gpios: GPIO pin to detect the external connector. See gpio binding.

Optional properties:
- debounce-ms: the debounce dealy for GPIO pin in millisecond.
- wakeup-source: Boolean, extcon can wake-up the system from suspend.
  if gpio provided in extcon-gpio DT node is registered as interrupt,
  then extcon can wake-up the system from suspend if wakeup-source property
  is available in DT node, if gpio registered as interrupt but wakeup-source
  is not available in DT node, then system wake-up due to extcon events
  not supported.

Example: Examples of extcon-gpio node as listed below:

	usb_cable: extcon-gpio-0 {
		compatible = "extcon-gpio";
		extcon-id = <EXTCON_USB>;
		extcon-gpio = <&gpio6 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	}

	ta_cable: extcon-gpio-1 {
		compatible = "extcon-gpio";
		extcon-id = <EXTCON_CHG_USB_DCP>;
		extcon-gpio = <&gpio3 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		debounce-ms = <50>;	/* 50 millisecond */
		wakeup-source;
	}

	&dwc3_usb {
		extcon = <&usb_cable>;
	};

	&charger {
		extcon = <&ta_cable>;
	};
