Lattice iCE40 FPGA Manager

Required properties:
- compatible:		should contain "lattice,ice40-fpga-mgr"
- reg:			SPI chip select
- spi-max-frequency:	Maximum SPI frequency (>=1000000, <=25000000)
- cdone-gpio:		GPIO connected to CDONE pin
- creset_b-gpio:	GPIO connected to CRESET_B pin. Note that CRESET_B is
			treated as an active-low output because the signal is
			treated as an enable signal, rather than a reset. This
			is necessary because the FPGA will enter Master SPI
			mode and drive SCK with a clock signal, potentially
			jamming other devices on the bus, unless CRESET_B is
			held high until the firmware is loaded.

Example:
	ice40: ice40@0 {
		compatible = "lattice,ice40-fpga-mgr";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		cdone-gpio = <&gpio 24 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		creset_b-gpio = <&gpio 22 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
