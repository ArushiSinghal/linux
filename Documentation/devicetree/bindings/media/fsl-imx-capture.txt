Freescale i.MX IPUv3 capture subsystem
======================================

The i.MX5/6 IPUv3 capture subsystem consists of one or two IPUs and all
external subdevices connected to the IPU CSI input ports. On i.MX5 these
are only external subdevices. On i.MX6, there are additional SoC internal
multiplexers and a MIPI CSI-2 bridge connected to the CSI input ports via
of_graph bindings.

On i.MX6 variants with two IPUs, either a single capture subsystem node may be
defined, containing all CSI ports, or two separate capture subsystem nodes may
be defined, each containing the CSI ports of a single IPU. In the latter case
there must be no external of_graph links between the two subsystems.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,imx-capture-subsystem"
- ports: should contain a list of phandles pointing to the capture interface
  ports of IPU devices

Example:

capture-subsystem {
        compatible = "fsl,imx-capture-subsystem";
        ports = <&ipu1_csi0>, <&ipu1_csi1>, <&ipu2_csi0>, <&ipu2_csi1>;
};
