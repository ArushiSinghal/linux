Synopsys DesignWare CSI-2 Host controller

Description
-----------

This HW block is used to receive image coming from an MIPI CSI-2 compatible
camera.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "snps,dw-mipi-csi"
- reg		: physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
		  registers;
- interrupts	: CSI-2 Host interrupt
- data-lanes    : Number of lanes to be used
- output-type   : Core output to be used (IPI-> 0 or IDI->1 or BOTH->2)
- phys, phy-names: List of one PHY specifier and identifier string (as defined
  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt).

Optional properties(if in IPI mode):
- ipi-mode 	: Mode to be used when in IPI(Camera -> 0 or Automatic -> 1)
- ipi-color-mode: Color depth to be used in IPI (48 bits -> 0 or 16 bits -> 1)
- ipi-auto-flush: Data auto-flush (1 -> Yes or 0 -> No)
- virtual-channel: Virtual channel where data is present when in IPI

The per-board settings:
 - port sub-node describing a single endpoint connected to the dw-mipi-csi
   as described in video-interfaces.txt[1].
