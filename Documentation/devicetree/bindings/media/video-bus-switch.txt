Video Bus Switch Binding
========================

This is a binding for a gpio controlled switch for camera interfaces. Such a
device is used on some embedded devices to connect two cameras to the same
interface of a image signal processor.

Required properties
===================

compatible	: must contain "video-bus-switch"
switch-gpios	: GPIO specifier for the gpio, which can toggle the
		  selected camera. The GPIO should be configured, so
		  that a disabled GPIO means, that the first port is
		  selected.

Required Port nodes
===================

More documentation on these bindings is available in
video-interfaces.txt in the same directory.

reg		: The interface:
		  0 - port for image signal processor
		  1 - port for first camera sensor
		  2 - port for second camera sensor

Example
=======

video-bus-switch {
	compatible = "video-bus-switch"
	switch-gpios = <&gpio1 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			csi_switch_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csi_isp>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			csi_switch_out1: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csi_cam1>;
			};
		};

		port@2 {
			reg = <2>;

			csi_switch_out2: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csi_cam2>;
			};
		};
	};
};
