Renesas R-Car Gen3 DRIF controller (DRIF)
-----------------------------------------

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: "renesas,drif-r8a7795" if DRIF controller is a part of R8A7795 SoC.
	      "renesas,rcar-gen3-drif" for a generic R-Car Gen3 compatible device.
	      When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	      SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	      followed by the generic version.

- reg: offset and length of each sub-channel.
- interrupts: associated with each sub-channel.
- clocks: phandles and clock specifiers for each sub-channel.
- clock-names: clock input name strings: "fck0", "fck1".
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: must be "default".
- dmas: phandles to the DMA channels for each sub-channel.
- dma-names: names for the DMA channels: "rx0", "rx1".

Required child nodes:
---------------------
- Each DRIF channel can have one or both of the sub-channels enabled in a
  setup. The sub-channels are represented as a child node. The name of the
  child nodes are "sub-channel0" and "sub-channel1" respectively. Each child
  node supports the "status" property only, which is used to enable/disable
  the respective sub-channel.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- port: video interface child port node of a channel that defines the local
  and remote endpoints. The remote endpoint is assumed to a tuner subdevice
  endpoint.
- power-domains: phandle to respective power domain.
- renesas,syncmd       : sync mode
			 0 (Frame start sync pulse mode. 1-bit width pulse
			    indicates start of a frame)
			 1 (L/R sync or I2S mode) (default)
- renesas,lsb-first    : empty property indicates lsb bit is received first.
			 When not defined msb bit is received first (default)
- renesas,syncac-pol-high  : empty property indicates sync signal polarity.
			 When defined, active high or high->low sync signal.
			 When not defined, active low or low->high sync signal
			 (default)
- renesas,dtdl         : delay between sync signal and start of reception.
			 Must contain one of the following values:
			 0   (no bit delay)
			 50  (0.5-clock-cycle delay)
			 100 (1-clock-cycle delay) (default)
			 150 (1.5-clock-cycle delay)
			 200 (2-clock-cycle delay)
- renesas,syncdl       : delay between end of reception and sync signal edge.
			 Must contain one of the following values:
			 0   (no bit delay) (default)
			 50  (0.5-clock-cycle delay)
			 100 (1-clock-cycle delay)
			 150 (1.5-clock-cycle delay)
			 200 (2-clock-cycle delay)
			 300 (3-clock-cycle delay)
