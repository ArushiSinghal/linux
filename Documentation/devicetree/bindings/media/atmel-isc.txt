Atmel Image Sensor Controller (ISC)
----------------------------------------------

Required properties for ISC:
- compatible
	Must be "atmel,sama5d2-isc"
- reg
	Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device;
- interrupts
	Should contain IRQ line for the ISC;
- clocks
	List of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
	the clock-names property;
	Please refer to clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names
	Required elements: "hclock", "ispck".
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0
	Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt.
- clk-in-isc
	ISC internal clock node, it includes two clock nodes,
	isc-ispck and isc-mck.
- atmel,sensor-preferred
	ISC may convert the raw format to the specified format when the sensor
	outputs the raw format, and the sensor may output the specified format
	directly. If sensor is preferred to output the specified format
	directly, the value should be 1 (1-preferred, 0-not).
	The default value is 1.

ISC supports a single port node with parallel bus. It should contain one
'port' child node with child 'endpoint' node. Please refer to the bindings
defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Required properties for the ISC internal clocks:
- #address-cells
	should be 1 (reg is used to encode clk id).
- #size-cells
	should be 0 (reg is used to encode clk id).
- name
	device tree node describing a ISC internal clock.
	* #clock-cells: from common clock binding; should be set to 0.
	* reg: clock id, there are two values,
	       <0> is ISP clock, <1> is master clock.
	* clocks: shall be the isc internal clock source phandles.
		  e.g. clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&iscck>, <&isc_gclk>;

Example:
isc: isc@f0008000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-isc";
	reg = <0xf0008000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 5>;
	clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&isc_ispck>;
	clock-names = "hclock", "ispck";
	atmel,sensor-preferred = <1>;

	port {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		isc_0: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ov7740_0>;
			hsync-active = <1>;
			vsync-active = <0>;
			pclk-sample = <1>;
		};
	};

	clk-in-isc {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		isc_ispck: isc-ispck@0 {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;
			clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&iscck>;
		};

		isc_mck: isc-mck@1 {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			reg = <1>;
			clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&iscck>, <&isc_gclk>;
		};
	};
};

i2c1: i2c@fc028000 {
	ov7740: camera@21 {
	compatible = "ovti,ov7740";
	reg = <0x21>;

	clocks = <&isc_mck>;
	clock-names = "xvclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&isc_mck>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <24000000>;

	port {
		ov7740_0: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&isc_0>;
