Atmel Image Sensor Controller (ISC)
----------------------------------------------

Required properties for ISC:
- compatible
	Must be "atmel,sama5d2-isc"
- reg
	Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device;
- interrupts
	Should contain IRQ line for the ISI;
- clocks
	List of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
	the clock-names property;
	Please refer to clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names
	Required elements: "hclock", "ispck".
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0
	Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt.
- isc-ispck
	The clock for the ISC digital pipeline.
	- compatible
		Must be "atmel,sama5d2-isc-ispck".
	- clock-cells
		From common clock binding; should be set to 0.
	- clocks
		The clock source phandles.
- isc-mck
	The clock for the image sensor.
	- compatible
		Must be "atmel,sama5d2-isc-mck".
	- clock-cells
		From common clock binding; should be set to 0.
	- clocks
		The clock source phandles.

ISC supports a single port node with parallel bus. It should contain one
'port' child node with child 'endpoint' node. Please refer to the bindings
defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
isc: isc@f0008000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-isc";
	reg = <0xf0008000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 5>;
	clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&isc_ispck>;
	clock-names = "hclock", "ispck";

	port {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		isc_0: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ov7740_0>;
			hsync-active = <1>;
			vsync-active = <0>;
			pclk-sample = <1>;
		};
	};

	isc_ispck: isc-ispck@0 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-isc-ispck";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&iscck>;
	};

	isc_mck: isc-mck@1 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-isc-mck";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&isc_clk>, <&iscck>, <&isc_gclk>;
	};
};

i2c1: i2c@fc028000 {
	ov7740: camera@21 {
	compatible = "ovti,ov7740";
	reg = <0x21>;

	clocks = <&isc_mck>;
	clock-names = "xvclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&isc_mck>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <24000000>;

	port {
		ov7740_0: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&isc_0>;
		};
	};
};
