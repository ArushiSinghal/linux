Maxim Integrated MAX2175 RF to Bits tuner
-----------------------------------------

The MAX2175 IC is an advanced analog/digital hybrid-radio receiver with
RF to BitsÂ® front-end designed for software-defined radio solutions.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: "maxim,max2175" for MAX2175 RF-to-bits tuner.
- clocks: phandle to the fixed xtal clock.
- clock-names: name of the fixed xtal clock.
- port: child port node of a tuner that defines the local and remote
  endpoints. The remote endpoint is assumed to be an SDR device
  that is capable of receiving the digital samples from the tuner.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- maxim,slave	      : empty property indicates this is a slave of
			another master tuner. This is used to define two
			tuners in diversity mode (1 master, 1 slave). By
			default each tuner is an individual master.
- maxim,refout-load-pF: load capacitance value (in pF) on reference
			output drive level. The possible load values are
			 0pF (default - refout disabled)
			10pF
			20pF
			30pF
			40pF
			60pF
			70pF
- maxim,am-hiz	      : empty property indicates AM Hi-Z filter path is
			selected for AM antenna input. By default this
			filter path is not used.

Example:
--------

Board specific DTS file

/* Fixed XTAL clock node */
maxim_xtal: maximextal {
	compatible = "fixed-clock";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency = <36864000>;
};

/* A tuner device instance under i2c bus */
max2175_0: tuner@60 {
	compatible = "maxim,max2175";
	reg = <0x60>;
	clocks = <&maxim_xtal>;
	clock-names = "xtal";
	maxim,refout-load-pF = <10>;

	port {
		max2175_0_ep: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&slave_rx_v4l2_sdr_device>;
		};
	};

};
