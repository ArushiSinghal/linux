Maxim Integrated MAX2175 RF to Bits tuner
-----------------------------------------

The MAX2175 IC is an advanced analog/digital hybrid-radio receiver with
RF to BitsÂ® front-end designed for software-defined radio solutions.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: "maxim,max2175" for MAX2175 RF-to-bits tuner.
- clocks: phandle to the fixed xtal clock.
- clock-names: name of the fixed xtal clock.
- port: video interface child port node of a tuner that defines the local
  and remote endpoints. The remote endpoint is assumed to be an SDR device
  that is capable of receiving the digital samples from the tuner.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- maxim,slave	   : empty property indicates this is a slave of another
		     master tuner. This is used to define two tuners in
		     diversity mode (1 master, 1 slave). By default each
		     tuner is an individual master.
- maxim,refout-load: load capacitance value (in pF) on reference output
		     drive level. The mapping of these load values to
		     respective bit values are given below.
		     0 - Reference output disabled
		     1 - 10pF load
		     2 - 20pF load
		     3 - 30pF load
		     4 - 40pF load
		     5 - 60pF load
		     6 - 70pF load

Example:
--------

Board specific DTS file

/* Fixed XTAL clock node */
maxim_xtal: maximextal {
	compatible = "fixed-clock";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency = <36864000>;
};

/* A tuner device instance under i2c bus */
max2175_0: tuner@60 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "maxim,max2175";
	reg = <0x60>;
	clocks = <&maxim_xtal>;
	clock-names = "xtal";
	maxim,refout-load = <10>;

	port {
		max2175_0_ep: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&slave_rx_v4l2_sdr_device>;
		};
	};
