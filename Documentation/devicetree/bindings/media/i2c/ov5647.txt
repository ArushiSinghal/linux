Omnivision OV5647 raw image sensor
---------------------------------

OV5647 is a raw image sensor with MIPI CSI-2 and CCP2 image data interfaces
and CCI (I2C compatible) control bus.

Required properties:

- compatible	: "ovti,ov5647";
- reg		: I2C slave address of the sensor;

The common video interfaces bindings (see video-interfaces.txt) should be
used to specify link to the image data receiver. The OV5647 device
node should contain one 'port' child node with an 'endpoint' subnode.

Following properties are valid for the endpoint node:

- data-lanes : (optional) specifies MIPI CSI-2 data lanes as covered in
  video-interfaces.txt.  The sensor supports only two data lanes.
