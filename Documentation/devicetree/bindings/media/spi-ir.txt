Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through SPI bus which is used as
remote controller.

The IR LED switch is connected to the MOSI line of the SPI device and the data
are delivered thourgh that.

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "ir-spi".

Optional properties:
	- irled,switch: specifies the gpio switch which enables the irled/
	- negated: boolean value that specifies whether the output is negated
	  with a NOT gate.
	- duty-cycle: 8 bit value that stores the percentage of the duty cycle.
	  it can be 50, 60, 70, 75, 80 or 90.

Example:

        irled@0 {
                compatible = "ir-spi";
                reg = <0x0>;
                spi-max-frequency = <5000000>;
                irled,switch = <&gpr3 3 0>;
		negated;
		duty-cycle = /bits/ 8 <60>;
        };
