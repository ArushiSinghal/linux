NVIDIA Tegra210 PMC IO pad controller

NVIDIA Tegra210 supports IO pads which can operate at 1.8V or 3.3V I/O
power rail source. SW needs to configure the voltage level of IO pads
based on platform specific power tree.

The voltage configurations of IO pads should be done in boot if it is not
going to change other wise dynamically based on IO rail voltage on that
IO pads.

The DT property of the io pads must be under the node of pmc i.e.
pmc@7000e400 for Tegra210.

Please refer to <pinctrl-bindings.txt> in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Tegra's pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for an
IO pads, or a list of IO pads. This configuration can include the voltage and
power enable/disable control

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content. Each subnode only affects those
parameters that are explicitly listed. Unspecified is represented as an absent
property,

See the TRM to determine which properties and values apply to each IO pads.
Macro values for property values are defined in
<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra210-io-pad.h>

The voltage supported on the pads are 1.8V and 3.3V. The enums are defined as:
	For 1.8V, use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV
	For 3.3V, use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV

Required subnode-properties:
==========================
- pins : An array of strings. Each string contains the name of an IO pads. Valid
	 values for these names are listed below.

Optional subnode-properties:
==========================
-nvidia,power-source-voltage:	Integer. The voltage level of IO pads. The
				valid values are 1.8V and 3.3V. Macros are
				defined for these voltage levels in
				<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra210-io-pad.h>
				Use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV for 1.8V
				Use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV for 3.3V

				All IO pads do not support the 1.8V/3.3V
				configurations. Valid values for "pins" are
				audio-hv, dmic, gpio, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, spi-hv.

Other than above, following properties are supported from generic pin
configuration explained in <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt>.
low-power-enable:		enable low power mode.
low-power-disable:		disable low power mode.

Valid values for pin for low power mode supports are:
	audio, audio-hv, cam, csia, csib, csic, csid, csie, csif,
	dbg, debug-nonao, dmic, dp, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, emmc, emmc2,
	gpio, hdmi, hsic, lvds, mipi-bias, pex-bias, pex-clk1, pex-clk2,
	pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, spi, spi-hv, uart, usb-bias, usb0,
	usb1, usb2, usb3.

Example:
	#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra210-io-pad.h>
	pmc@7000e400 {

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tegra_io_pad_volt_default>;
		tegra_io_pad_volt_default: common {
			audio-hv {
				pins = "audio-hv";
				nvidia,power-source-voltage = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV>;
			};

			gpio {
				pins = "gpio";
				invidia,power-source-voltage = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV>;
			};

			audio {
				pins = "audio", "dmic", "sdmmc1", "sdmmc3";
				low-power-enable;
			};
		};
	};
