NVIDIA Tegra PMC IO pad controller

NVIDIA Tegra124 and later SoCs support the multi-voltage level and
low power state of some of its IO pads. The IO pads can work in
the voltage of the 1.8V and 3.3V of IO power rail sources. When IO
interface are not used then IO pads can be configure in low power
state to reduce the power from that IO pads.

On Tegra124, the IO power rail source is auto detected by SoC and hence
it is only require to configure in low power mode if IO pads are not
used.

On T210 onwards, the auto-detection is removed from SoC and hence SW
must configure the PMC register explicitly to set proper voltage in
IO pads based on IO rail power source voltage.

The voltage configurations and low power state of IO pads should be done
in boot if it is not going to change other wise dynamically based on IO
rail voltage on that IO pads and usage of IO pads

The DT property of the io pads must be under the node of pmc i.e.
pmc@7000e400 for Tegra124 onwards.

Please refer to <pinctrl-bindings.txt> in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Tegra's pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for an
IO pads, or a list of IO pads. This configuration can include the voltage and
power enable/disable control

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content. Each subnode only affects those
parameters that are explicitly listed. Unspecified is represented as an absent
property,

See the TRM to determine which properties and values apply to each IO pads.
Macro values for property values are defined in
<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra-io-pad.h>

The voltage supported on the pads are 1.8V and 3.3V. The enums are defined as:
	For 1.8V, use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV
	For 3.3V, use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV

Required subnode-properties:
==========================
- pins : An array of strings. Each string contains the name of an IO pads. Valid
	 values for these names are listed below.

Optional subnode-properties:
==========================
-nvidia,power-source-voltage:	Integer. The voltage level of IO pads. The
				valid values are 1.8V and 3.3V. Macros are
				defined for these voltage levels in
				<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra-io-pad.h>
				Use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV for 1.8V
				Use TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV for 3.3V

				All IO pads do not support the 1.8V/3.3V
				configurations. Valid values for "pins" are
				audio-hv, dmic, gpio, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, spi-hv.

Other than above, following properties are supported from generic pin
configuration explained in <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt>.
low-power-enable:		enable low power mode.
low-power-disable:		disable low power mode.

Valid values for pin for T124 are:
	audio, bb, cam, comp, csia, csib, csie, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, hdmi,
	hsic, hv, lvds, mipi-bias, nand, pex-bias, pex-clk1, pex-clk2,
	pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, sdmmc4, sys-ddc, uart, usb0, usb1, usb2,
	usb-bias

	All above pins support low power mode.

Valid values for pin for T210 are:
	audio, audio-hv, cam, csia, csib, csic, csid, csie, csif,
	dbg, debug-nonao, dmic, dp, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, emmc, emmc2,
	gpio, hdmi, hsic, lvds, mipi-bias, pex-bias, pex-clk1, pex-clk2,
	pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, spi, spi-hv, uart, usb-bias, usb0,
	usb1, usb2, usb3.

	All above pins support low power mode. However, all IO pads do not
	support the 1.8V/3.3V configurations. Valid values for
	nvidia,io-pad-voltage are:
		audio, audio-hv, cam, dbg, dmic, gpio, pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3,
		spi, spi-hv,uart

Example:
	#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra-io-pad.h>
	pmc@7000e400 {

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tegra_io_pad_volt_default>;
		tegra_io_pad_volt_default: common {
			audio-hv {
				pins = "audio-hv";
				nvidia,power-source-voltage = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_3300000UV>;
			};

			gpio {
				pins = "gpio";
				invidia,power-source-voltage = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_POWER_SOURCE_1800000UV>;
			};

			audio {
				pins = "audio", "dmic", "sdmmc1", "sdmmc3";
				low-power-enable;
			};
		};
	};
