NVIDIA Tegra PMC IO pad controller

NVIDIA Tegra124 and later SoCs support the multi-voltage level and low power
state of some of its IO pads. When IO interface are not used then IO pads can
be configure in low power state to reduce the power from that IO pads. The IO
pads can work in the nominal IO voltage of 1.8V and 3.3V from power rail
sources.

On Tegra124, the voltage of IO power rail source is auto detected by SoC and
hence it is only require to configure in low power mode if IO pads are not
used.

On T210 onwards, the HW based auto-detection for IO voltage is removed and
hence SW need to configure the PMC register explicitly, to set proper voltage
in IO pads, based on IO rail power source voltage.

The voltage configurations and low power state of IO pads should be done in
boot if it is not going to change otherwise dynamically based on IO rail
voltage on that IO pads and usage of IO pads

The DT property of the IO pads must be under the node of pmc i.e.
pmc@7000e400 for Tegra124 onwards.

Please refer to <pinctrl-bindings.txt> in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Tegra's pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for an
IO pads, or a list of IO pads. This configuration can include the voltage and
power enable/disable control

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content. Each subnode only affects those
parameters that are explicitly listed. Unspecified is represented as an absent
property,

See the TRM to determine which properties and values apply to each IO pads.

Required subnode-properties:
==========================
- pins : An array of strings. Each string contains the name of an IO pads. Valid
	 values for these names are listed below.

Optional subnode-properties:
==========================
Following properties are supported from generic pin configuration explained
in <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt>.
low-power-enable:		enable low power mode.
low-power-disable:		disable low power mode.

Valid values for pin for T124 are:
	audio, bb, cam, comp, csia, csib, csie, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, hdmi,
	hsic, hv, lvds, mipi-bias, nand, pex-bias, pex-clk1, pex-clk2,
	pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, sdmmc4, sys-ddc, uart, usb0, usb1, usb2,
	usb-bias

Valid values for pin for T210 are:
	audio, audio-hv, cam, csia, csib, csic, csid, csie, csif,
	dbg, debug-nonao, dmic, dp, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, emmc, emmc2,
	gpio, hdmi, hsic, lvds, mipi-bias, pex-bias, pex-clk1, pex-clk2,
	pex-ctrl, sdmmc1, sdmmc3, spi, spi-hv, uart, usb-bias, usb0,
	usb1, usb2, usb3.

To find out the IO rail voltage for setting the voltage of IO pad by SW,
the regulator supply handle must provided from the DT and it is explained
in the regulator DT binding document
	<devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt>.
For example, for GPIO rail the supply name is vddio-gpio and regulator
handle is supplied from DT as
	vddio-gpio-supply = <&regulator_xyz>;

For T210, following IO pads support the 1.8V/3.3V and the corresponding
IO voltage pin names are as follows:
	audio -> vddio-audio
	audio-hv -> vddio-audio-hv
	cam ->vddio-cam
	dbg -> vddio-dbg
	dmic -> vddio-dmic
	gpio -> vddio-gpio
	pex-ctrl -> vddio-pex-ctrl
	sdmmc1 -> vddio-sdmmc1
	sdmmc3 -> vddio-sdmmc3
	spi -> vddio-spi
	spi-hv -> vddio-spi-hv
	uart -> vddio-uart

Example:
	i2c@7000d000 {
		pmic@3c {
			regulators {
				vddio_sdmmc1: ldo2 {
					/* Regulator entries for LDO2 */
				};

				vdd_cam: ldo3 {
					/* Regulator entries for LDO3 */
				};
			};
		};
	};

	pmc@7000e400 {
		vddio-cam-supply = <&vdd_cam>;
		vddio-sdmmc1-supply = <&vddio_sdmmc1>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tegra_io_pad_volt_default>;
		tegra_io_pad_volt_default: common {
			audio-hv {
				pins = "audio-hv";
				low-power-disable;
			};

			gpio {
				pins = "gpio";
				low-power-disable;
			};

			audio {
				pins = "audio", "dmic", "sdmmc3";
				low-power-enable;
			};
		};

	};
