Pincontrol driver for MAX77620 Power management IC from Maxim Semiconductor.

Device has 8 GPIO pins which can be configured as GPIO as well as the
special IO functions.

Please refer file <devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt>
for details of the common pinctrl bindings used by client devices,
including the meaning of the phrase "pin configuration node".

Optional Pinmux properties:
--------------------------
Following properties are require if pin control setting is required at boot.
- pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state named per <pinctrl-binding.txt>.
- pinctrl[0...n]: Properties to contain the phandle for pinctrl states per
		<pinctrl-binding.txt>.

The pin configurations are defined as child of the pinctrl states node. Each
sub-node have following properties:

Required properties:
- pins: List of pins. Valid values of pins properties are:
		      gpio0, gpio1, gpio2, gpio3, gpio4, gpio5, gpio6, gpio7.

Optional properties:
Following are optional properties defined as pinmux DT binding document
<pinctrl-bindings.txt>. Absence of properties will leave the configuration
on default.
	function,
	drive-push-pull,
	drive-open-drain,
	bias-pull-up,
	bias-pull-down.

Valid values for function properties are:
	gpio, lpm-control-in, fps-out, 32k-out, sd0-dvs-in, sd1-dvs-in,
	reference-out

Theres is also customised properties for the GPIO1, GPIO2 and GPIO3.
The properties are required to configure these resource FPS parameters
when system is in "active" state or in "suspend" state.
Here "active" state means system is UP and working normally.
"suspend" state means system enters into the suspend state.

- maxim,active-fps-source:	     FPS source for the gpios in active state
				     of the GPIO. Valid values are FPS_SRC_0,
				     FPS_SRC_1, FPS_SRC_2 and FPS_SRC_NONE.
				     Absence of this property will leave the pin
				     on default.
- maxim,active-fps-power-up-slot:    Power up slot on given FPS for active state.
				     Valid values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,active-fps-power-down-slot:  Power down slot on given FPS for active
				     state. Valid values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,suspend-fps-source:	     Suspend state FPS source. Valid values are
				     same as maxim,active-fps-source.
- maxim,suspend-fps-power-down-slot: Suspend state power down slot. Valid
				     values are 0 to 7.
- maxim,suspend-fps-power-up-slot: Suspend state power up slot. Valid values
				     are 0 to 7.

Example:
--------
#include <dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h>
...
max77620@3c {

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spmic_default>;

	spmic_default: pinmux@0 {
		pin_gpio0 {
			pins = "gpio0";
			function = "gpio";
		};

		pin_gpio1 {
			pins = "gpio1";
			function = "fps-out";
			maxim,fps-source = <FPS_SRC_0>;
		};

		pin_gpio2 {
			pins = "gpio2";
			function = "fps-out";
			maxim,fps-source = <FPS_SRC_1>;
		};
	};
};
