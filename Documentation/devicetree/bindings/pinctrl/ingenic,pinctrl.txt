Ingenic jz47xx pin controller

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

For the jz47xx SoCs, pin control is tightly bound with GPIO ports. All pins may
be used as GPIOs, multiplexed device functions are configured within the
GPIO port configuration registers and it is typical to refer to pins using the
naming scheme "PxN" where x is a character identifying the GPIO port with
which the pin is associated and N is an integer from 0 to 31 identifying the
pin within that GPIO port. For example PA0 is the first pin in GPIO port A, and
PB31 is the last pin in GPIO port B. The jz4740 contains 4 GPIO ports, PA to
PD, for a total of 128 pins. The jz4780 contains 6 GPIO ports, PA to PF, for a
total of 192 pins.


Pin controller node
===================

Required properties:
- compatible: One of:
  - "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl"
  - "ingenic,jz4780-pinctrl"

Optional properties:
- ingenic,pull-ups: A list of 32-bit bit fields, where each bit set tells the
  driver that a pull-up resistor is available for this pin.
  By default, the driver considers that all pins feature a pull-up resistor.
- ingenic,pull-downs: A list of 32-bit bit fields, where each bit set tells
  the driver that a pull-down resistor is available for this pin.
  By default, the driver considers that all pins feature a pull-down
  resistor.


'functions' sub-node
====================

The 'functions' node will contain sub-nodes that correspond to pin function
nodes, and no properties. Pin function nodes will contain sub-nodes that
correspond to pin groups, and no properties.

The names of the pin function nodes will end up being the available functions
provided by the pinctrl driver.
The names of the pin group nodes will end up being the available groups
provided by the pinctrl driver.

Required properties for pin groups:
- ingenic,pins: <pin mode [pin mode ...]>;
  where 'pin' is the number of the pin, and 'mode' is the function mode of the
  pin that should be enabled for this group.


Example:
=======

pinctrl: ingenic-pinctrl@10010000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl";
	reg = <0x10010000 0x400>;

	ingenic,pull-ups   = <0xffffffff 0xffffffff 0xffffffff 0xdfffffff>;
	ingenic,pull-downs = <0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000>;

	functions {
		mmc {
			mmc-1bit {
				/* CLK, CMD, D0 */
				ingenic,pins = <0x69 0 0x68 0 0x6a 0>;
			};

			mmc-4bit {
				/* D1, D2, D3 */
				ingenic,pins = <0x6b 0 0x6c 0 0x6d 0>;
			};
		};
	};
};
