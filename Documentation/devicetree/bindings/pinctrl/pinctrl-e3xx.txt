USRP E3xx Pincontrol bindings

The pins of the NI Ettus Research USRP E3xx idle image can be configured for different
daughterboard configurations. This pinmux is implemented in an FPGA as soft core.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of the following:
  - "ettus,pinctrl-e3xx-1.0"
- clocks: The clock driving the pinmux

Example:

	e3xx_pinctrl: e3xx-pinctrl@40200a00 {
		compatible = "ettus,e3xx-pinctrl-1.0";
		reg = <0x40200a00 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clkc 15>;

		foo_state: pinconf {
			conf {
				pins = E31X_LED_RX1_RX;
				output-low;
			};
		};
	};

Note: Constants that facilitate creation of devicetree files are available in
      include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-e3xx.h
