J-Core Programmable Interval Timer and Clocksource

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "jcore,pit".

- reg: Memory region for timer/clocksource registers.

- interrupts: An interrupt to assign for the timer. The actual pit
  core is integrated with the aic and allows the timer interrupt
  assignment to be programmed by software, but this property is
  required in order to reserve an interrupt number that doesn't
  conflict with other devices.

Optional properties:

- cpu-offset: For SMP, the per-cpu offset to the local timer
  programming memory range.


Example:

timer@200 {
	compatible = "jcore,pit";
	reg = < 0x200 0x30 >;
	cpu-offset = < 0x300 >;
	interrupts = < 0x48 >;
};
