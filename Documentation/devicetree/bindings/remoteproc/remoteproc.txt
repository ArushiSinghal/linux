Common remoteproc properties

A remoteproc node represents the mechanism and resources needed for controlling
a co-processor's life cycle; including loading firmware, booting, shutting down
and handling exceptions.


= Consumer properties
A consumer node referencing a remoteproc node, so that it can requests life
cycle transitions can use the following properties:

- rprocs:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: a list of phandle references to remoteproc nodes

- rproc-names:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: a list of strings naming each entry in "rprocs", allowing
		    consumer drivers to look up remoteprocs by name
