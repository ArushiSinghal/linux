* Microchip PIC32 SPI device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32mzda-spi".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain all three spi interrupts in sequence
              of <fault-irq>, <receive-irq>, <transmit-irq>.
- interrupt-names: Should be "fault","rx","tx" in order.
- clocks: phandles of baud generation clocks. Maximum two possible clocks
	  can be provided (&PBCLK2, &REFCLKO1).
          See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- clock-names: Should be "mck0","mck1".
               See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
- pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state names "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0: Phandle referencing pin configuration of the SPI peripheral.
             See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt

Optional properties:
- cs-gpios: List of GPIO chip selects. See ../spi/spi-bus.txt
            See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
- dmas: Two or more DMA channel specifiers following the convention outlined
        in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: Names for the dma channels. There must be at least one channel
             named "spi-tx" for transmit and named "spi-rx" for receive.

Example:

	spi1:spi@0x1f821000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-spi";
		reg = <0x1f821000 0x200>;
		interrupts = <109 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			<110 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			<111 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "fault", "rx", "tx";
		clocks = <&PBCLK2>, <&REFCLKO1>;
		clock-names = "mck0", "mck1";
		dmas = <&dma 134>,
			<&dma 135>;
		dma-names = "spi-rx", "spi-tx";
		cs-gpios = <&gpio3 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,
			<&gpio3 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
