HiSilicon SPI-NOR Flash Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "hisilicon,hisi-sfc".
- address-cells: number of cells required to define a chip select
        address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1. See spi-bus.txt.
- size-cells:Should be 0.
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the controller device.
- reg-names: Must include the following two entries:"control","memory".
- clocks: handle to spi-nor flash controller clock.

Example:
spi-nor-controller@14000000 {
	compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-sfc";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x10000000 0x1000>, <0x14000000 0x1000000>;
	reg-names = "control", "memory";
	clocks = <&clock HI3519_FMC_CLK>;
	spi-nor@0 {
		compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
		reg = <0>;
	};
};
