Allwinner A10 SPI controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "allwinner,sun4-a10-spi".
- reg: Should contain register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt.
- clocks: phandle to the clocks feeding the SPI controller. Two are
          needed:
  - "ahb": the gated AHB parent clock
  - "mod": the parent module clock
- clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above

Optional properties for slave devices:
- sun4i,spi-wdelay : delay between transmission of words, specified in number
  of SPI clock periods (actual delay is wdelay + 3 clock periods)

Example:

spi1: spi@01c06000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-spi";
	reg = <0x01c06000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <11>;
	clocks = <&ahb_gates 21>, <&spi1_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "mod";
	status = "disabled";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	spi1_0 {
		compatible = "example,dummy";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>; /* 1Mhz = 1us clock period */
		sun4i,spi-wdelay = <2>; /* delay 5us (2 + 3 clock periods) */
	};
};
