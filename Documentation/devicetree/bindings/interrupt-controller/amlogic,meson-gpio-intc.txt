Amlogic meson GPIO interrupt controller

Meson SoCs contains an interrupt controller which is able watch the SoC pads
and generate an interrupt on edges or level. The controller is essentially a
256 pads to 8 GIC interrupt multiplexer, with a filter block to select edge
or level and polarity. We don’t expose all 256 mux inputs because the
documentation shows that upper part is not mapped to any pad. The actual number
of interrupt exposed depends on the SoC.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be either
   "amlogic,meson8-gpio-intc” for meson8 SoCs (AML7826MX) or
   “amlogic,meson8b-gpio-intc” for meson8b SoCs (S805) or
   “amlogic,meson-gxbb-gpio-intc” for GXBB SoCs (S905)
- interrupt-parent : a phandle to the GIC the interrupts are routed to.
   Usually this is provided at the root level of the device tree as it is
   common to most of the SoC
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
   interrupt source. The value must be 2.

Example:

gpio_interrupt: interrupt-controller@9880 {
	compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-gpio-intc";
	reg = <0x0 0x9880 0x0 0x10>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
};
