J-Core Advanced Interrupt Controller

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "jcore,aic1" for the (obsolete) first-generation aic
  with 8 interrupt lines with programmable priorities, or "jcore,aic2" for
  the "aic2" core with 64 interrupts.

- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller

- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value shall be 1.

Additional properties required for aic1:

- reg : Memory region for configuration.

- cpu-offset : For SMP, the offset to the per-cpu memory region for
  configuration, to be scaled by the cpu number.


Example:

aic: interrupt-controller {
	compatible = "jcore,aic2";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
};
