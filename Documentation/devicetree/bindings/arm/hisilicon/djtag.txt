The Hisilicon Djtag is an independent component which connects with some other
components in the SoC by Debug Bus. The djtag is available in CPU and IO dies
in the chip. The djtag controls access to connecting modules of CPU and IO
dies.
The various connecting components in CPU die (like L3 cache, L3 cache PMU etc.)
are accessed by djtag during real time debugging. In IO die there are connecting
components like RSA. These components appear as devices attached to djtag bus.

Hisilicon HiP05/06/07 djtag for CPU and IO die
Required properties:
  - compatible : The value should be as follows
	(a) "hisilicon,hip05-djtag-v1" for CPU and IO die which use v1 hw in
	    HiP05 chipset.
	(b) "hisilicon,hip06-djtag-v1" for CPU die which use v1 hw in HiP06 chipset.
	(c) "hisilicon,hip06-djtag-v2" for IO die which use v2 hw in HiP06 chipset.
	(d) "hisilicon,hip07-djtag-v2" for CPU and IO die which use v2 hw in
	    HiP07 chipset.
  - reg : Register address and size
  - hisi-scl-id : The Super Cluster ID for CPU or IO die

Example 1: Djtag for CPU die

	/* for Hisilicon HiP05 djtag for CPU Die */
	djtag0: djtag@80010000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-djtag-v1";
		reg = <0x0 0x80010000 0x0 0x10000>;
		hisi-scl-id = <0x02>;

		/* All connecting components will appear as child nodes */
	};

Example 2: Djtag for IO die

	/* for Hisilicon HiP05 djtag for IO Die */
	djtag1: djtag@d0000000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-djtag-v1";
		reg = <0x0 0xd0000000 0x0 0x10000>;
		hisi-scl-id = <0x01>;

		/* All connecting components will appear as child nodes */
	};
