The vhost-pci design provides KVM with a faster and more scalable inter-VM
communication mechanism. In NFV usages and today's virtualized datacenters,
where multiple VMs connect to a centralized vswitch to communicate, the more
the VMs connect to (or chained via) the vswitch, the lower the inter-VM
communication throughput will be. The vhost-pci design successfully resolves
this scalability issue and makes KVM a better hypervisor for NFV and
datacenters.
