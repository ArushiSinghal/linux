	  This is a simple debugfs interface to inject MCEs and test different
	  aspects of the MCE handling code.

	  WARNING: Do not even assume this interface is staying stable!

	---help---
	  This is a small cache which collects correctable memory errors per 4K
	  page PFN and counts their repeated occurrence. Once the counter for a
	  PFN overflows, we try to soft-offline that page as we take it to mean
	  that it has reached a relatively high error count and would probably
	  be best if we don't use it anymore.
