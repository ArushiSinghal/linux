	  The Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) enables the ability to offload
	  sensor polling and algorithm processing to a dedicated low power
	  processor in the chipset. This allows the core processor to go into
	  low power modes more often, resulting in the increased battery life.
	  The current processors that support ISH are: Cherrytrail, Skylake,
	  Broxton and Kaby Lake.

	  Say Y here if you want to support Intel ISH. If unsure, say N.
