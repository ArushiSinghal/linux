	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

	depends on OF && (ARCH_LPC18XX || COMPILE_TEST)
	depends on MFD_SYSCON
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support NXP LPC18xx/43xx internal USB OTG PHY.

	  This driver is need for USB0 support on LPC18xx/43xx and takes
	  care of enabling and clock setup.

config PHY_MT65XX_USB3
	tristate "Mediatek USB3.0 PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK && OF
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to add support for Mediatek USB3.0 PHY driver
	  for mt65xx SoCs. it supports two usb2.0 ports and
	  one usb3.0 port.

config PHY_PISTACHIO_USB
	tristate "IMG Pistachio USB2.0 PHY driver"
	depends on MACH_PISTACHIO
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB2.0 PHY on the IMG Pistachio SoC.

config PHY_XGENE
	tristate "APM X-Gene 15Gbps PHY support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM && OF && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST)
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  This option enables support for APM X-Gene SoC multi-purpose PHY.
