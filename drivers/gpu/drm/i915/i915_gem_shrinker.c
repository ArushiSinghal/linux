/**
 * i915_gem_shrink - Shrink buffer object caches
 * @dev_priv: i915 device
 * @target: amount of memory to make available, in pages
 * @flags: control flags for selecting cache types
 *
 * This function is the main interface to the shrinker. It will try to release
 * up to @target pages of main memory backing storage from buffer objects.
 * Selection of the specific caches can be done with @flags. This is e.g. useful
 * when purgeable objects should be removed from caches preferentially.
 *
 * Note that it's not guaranteed that released amount is actually available as
 * free system memory - the pages might still be in-used to due to other reasons
 * (like cpu mmaps) or the mm core has reused them before we could grab them.
 * Therefore code that needs to explicitly shrink buffer objects caches (e.g. to
 * avoid deadlocks in memory reclaim) must fall back to i915_gem_shrink_all().
 *
 * Also note that any kind of pinning (both per-vma address space pins and
 * backing storage pins at the buffer object level) result in the shrinker code
 * having to skip the object.
 *
 * Returns:
 * The number of pages of backing storage actually released.
