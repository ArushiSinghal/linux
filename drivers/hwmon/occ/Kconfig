	bool "PPC On-Chip Controller"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support to monitor Power CPU
	  sensors via the On-Chip Controller (OCC).

	  Generally this is used by management controllers such as a BMC
	  on an OpenPower system.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called occ.
