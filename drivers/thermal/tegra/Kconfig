	  Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA
	  Tegra124 systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones
	  (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX). Cooling devices can be bound to the thermal
	  zones to manage temperatures. This option is also required for the
	  emergency thermal reset (thermtrip) feature to function.
