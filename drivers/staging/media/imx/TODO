- imx-csi subdev is not being autoloaded as a kernel module, probably
  because ipu_add_client_devices() does not register the IPU client
  platform devices, but only allocates those devices.

- Verify driver remove paths.

- Currently registering with notifications from subdevs are only
  available through the subdev device nodes and not through the main
  capture device node. Need to come up with a way to find the camif in
  the current pipeline that owns the subdev that sent the notify.

- Need to decide whether a mem2mem device should be incorporated into
  the media graph, or whether it should be a separate device that does
  not link with any other entities.
