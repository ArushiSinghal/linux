	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  Performing a write to a counter's IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW sets the counter and
	  also clears the counter's respective clearable flags (BORROW, CARRY,
	  COMPARE, SIGN, and ERROR). Interrupts are not supported by this driver.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter.
