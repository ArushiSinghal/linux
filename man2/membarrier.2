.TH MEMBARRIER 2 2015-04-15 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
membarrier \- issue memory barriers on a set of threads
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <linux/membarrier.h>
.sp
.BI "int membarrier(int " cmd ", int " flags ");
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The membarrier system call helps reducing overhead of memory barrier
instructions required to order memory accesses on multi-core systems.
However, this system call is heavier than a memory barrier, so using it
effectively is
.B not
as simple as replacing memory barriers with this
system call, but requires understanding the following:

Use of memory barriers needs to be done taking into account that a
memory barrier always needs to be either matched with its memory barrier
counterparts, or that the architecture's memory model don't require the
matching barriers.

There are cases where one side of the matching barriers (which we will
refer to as "fast side") is executed much more often than the other
(which we will refer to as "slow side"). This is a prime target for the
membarrier system call. The key idea is to replace, for these matching
barriers, the fast side memory barriers by simple compiler barriers,
e.g.:

  asm volatile ("" : : : "memory")

and replace the slow side memory barriers by the membarrier system call.

This will add overhead to the slow side, and remove overhead from the
fast side, thus resulting in an overall performance increase as long as
the slow side is infrequent enough that the membarrier system call
overhead does not counterweight the performance gain on the fast side.

Examples where this system call can be useful includes implementations
of Ready-Copy Update librarires, and garbage collectors.

The
.I cmd
argument is one of the following:

.TP
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
Query the set of supported commands. It returns a bitmask of supported
commands.
.TP
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED
Ensure that all threads from all processes on the system pass through a
state where all memory accesses to user-space addresses match program
order between entry to and return from the membarrier system call.
All threads on the system are targeted by this command. This command
returns 0.

.PP
The
.I cmd
argument expects a one-hot bit of a bitmask, except for the
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
command which has the value 0. This query command is always supported,
even though it is not part of the bitmask.

.PP
The
.I flags
argument is currently unused.

.PP
All memory accesses performed in program order from each targeted thread
is guaranteed to be ordered with respect to sys_membarrier(). If we use
the semantic "barrier()" to represent a compiler barrier forcing memory
accesses to be performed in program order across the barrier, and
smp_mb() to represent explicit memory barriers forcing full memory
ordering across the barrier, we have the following ordering table for
each pair of barrier(), sys_membarrier() and smp_mb():

The pair ordering is detailed as (O: ordered, X: not ordered):

                       barrier()   smp_mb() sys_membarrier()
       barrier()          X           X            O
       smp_mb()           X           O            O
       sys_membarrier()   O           O            O

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, this system call returns zero.  On error, \-1 is returned,
and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
For a given command, with flags argument set to 0, this system call is
guaranteed to always return the same value until reboot. Therefore, it
is sufficient to handle errors in a program or library initialization
function. Further calls with the same parameters will lead to the same
result. Therefore, for flag argument set to 0, error handling is only
required for the first calls to the
.BR membarrier ()
system call in an application.

.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOSYS
System call is not implemented.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I cmd
is invalid or
.I flags
is non-zero.

.SH VERSIONS
The membarrier system call was added in Linux 4.3.

.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR membarrier ()
is Linux-specific.

.SH NOTES

A memory barrier instruction is part of the instruction set of
architectures with weakly-ordered memory models. It orders memory
accesses prior to the barrier and after the barrier with respect to
matching barriers on other cores. For instance, a load fence can order
loads prior to and following that fence with respect to stores ordered
by store fences.

Program order is the order in which instructions are ordered in the
program assembly code.

.SH EXAMPLE

Assuming a multithreaded application where "fast_path()" is executed
very frequently, and where "slow_path()" is executed infrequently, the
following code (x86) can be transformed using
.BR membarrier()
:

.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

static volatile int a, b;

static void fast_path(void)
{
	int read_a, read_b;

	read_b = b;
	asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
	read_a = a;
	/* read_b == 1 implies read_a == 1. */
	if (read_b == 1 && read_a == 0)
		abort();
}

static void slow_path(void)
{
	a = 1;
	asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
	b = 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	/*
	 * Real applications would call fast_path() and slow_path() from
	 * different threads. Call those from main() to keep this
	 * example short.
	 */
	slow_path();
	fast_path();
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
.fi

The code above transformed to use the
.BR membarrier()
system call becomes:

.nf
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <linux/membarrier.h>

static volatile int a, b;

static int membarrier(int cmd, int flags)
{
	return syscall(__NR_membarrier, cmd, flags);
}

static int init_membarrier(void)
{
	int ret;

	/* Ensure that membarrier is supported. */
	ret = membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY, 0);
	if (ret < 0) {
		perror("membarrier");
		return -1;
	}
	if (!(ret & MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED)) {
		fprintf(stderr,
			"membarrier does not support MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED.\\n");
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}

static void fast_path(void)
{
	int read_a, read_b;

	read_b = b;
	asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
	read_a = a;
	/* read_b == 1 implies read_a == 1. */
	if (read_b == 1 && read_a == 0)
		abort();
}

static void slow_path(void)
{
	a = 1;
	membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED, 0);
	b = 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (init_membarrier())
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	/*
	 * Real applications would call fast_path() and slow_path() from
	 * different threads. Call those from main() to keep this
	 * example short.
	 */
	slow_path();
	fast_path();
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
.fi
