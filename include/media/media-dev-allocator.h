/**
 * DOC: Media Controller Device Allocator API
 * There are known problems with media device life time management. When media
 * device is released while an media ioctl is in progress, ioctls fail with
 * use-after-free errors and kernel hangs in some cases.
 *
 * Media Device can be in any the following states:
 *
 * - Allocated
 * - Registered (could be tied to more than one driver)
 * - Unregistered, not in use (media device file is not open)
 * - Unregistered, in use (media device file is not open)
 * - Released
 *
 * When media device belongs to  more than one driver, registrations should be
 * refcounted to avoid unregistering when one of the drivers does unregister.
 * A refcount field in the struct media_device covers this case. Unregister on
 * a Media Allocator media device is a kref_put() call. The media device should
 * be unregistered only when the last unregister occurs.
 *
 * When a media device is in use when it is unregistered, it should not be
 * released until the application exits when it detects the unregistered
 * status. Media device that is in use when it is unregistered is moved to
 * to_delete_list. When the last unregister occurs, media device is unregistered
 * and becomes an unregistered, still allocated device. Unregister marks the
 * device to be deleted.
 *
 * When media device belongs to more than one driver, as both drivers could be
 * unbound/bound, driver should not end up getting stale media device that is
 * on its way out. Moving the unregistered media device to to_delete_list helps
 * this case as well.
