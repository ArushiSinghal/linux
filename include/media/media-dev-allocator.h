/**
 * DOC: Media Controller Device Allocator API
 *
 * When media device belongs to more than one driver, the shared media device
 * is allocated with the shared struct device as the key for look ups.
 *
 * Shared media device should stay in registered state until the last driver
 * unregisters it. In addition, media device should be released when all the
 * references are released. Each driver gets a reference to the media device
 * during probe, when it allocates the media device. If media device is already
 * allocated, allocate API bumps up the refcount and return the existing media
 * device. Driver puts the reference back from its disconnect routine when it
 * calls media_device_delete().
 *
 * Media device is unregistered and cleaned up from the kref put handler to
 * ensure that the media device stays in registered state until the last driver
 * unregisters the media device.
 *
 * Driver Usage:
 *
 * Drivers should use the media-core routines to get register reference and
 * call media_device_delete() routine to make sure the shared media device
 * delete is handled correctly.
 *
 * driver probe:
 *	Call media_device_usb_allocate() to allocate or get a reference
 *	Call media_device_register(), if media devnode isn't registered
 *
 * driver disconnect:
 *	Call media_device_delete() to free the media_device. Free'ing is
 *	handled by the put handler.
