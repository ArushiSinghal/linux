The vhost-pci design is currently suitable for a group of VMs who trust each
other. To extend it to a more general use case, two security features can be
added in the future.

1 vIOMMU
vIOMMU provides the driver VM with the ability to restrict the device VM to
transiently access a specified portion of its memory. The vhost-pci design
proposed in this RFC can be extended to access the driver VM's memory with
vIOMMU. Precisely, the vIOMMU engine in the driver VM configures access
permissions (R/W) for the vhost-pci device to access its memory. More details
can be found at https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/kvm/Vm2vm+Mst and
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-08/msg03993.html

2 eptp switching
The idea of eptp swithing allows a vhost-pci device driver to access the mapped
driver VM's memory in an alternative view, where only a piece of trusted code
can access the driver VM's memory. More details can be found at
